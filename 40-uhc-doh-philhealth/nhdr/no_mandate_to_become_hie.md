# No Mandate to become HIE

Based on the analysis of the sources, your query can be addressed by differentiating between the explicit *mandate* for Health Information Exchange (HIE) technology and the use of the specific *term* "Local HIE."

While the sources do not appear to use the precise term "Local HIE" or "HCPN HIE," **it is explicit that the operational requirements for Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs) mandate the creation and maintenance of systems that function as local HIEs.**

The guidance for building such networks is provided through mandates on interoperability, specific functionality, and linkage requirements, operationalized through the Integrated Health Information System (iHIS) framework and the Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV) process.

Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

### 1. Explicit Mandate for HIE Functionality within HCPNs

The operationalization of the HCPN model requires technological capabilities that define a functioning HIE at the network level:

- **Interoperable EMR Requirement:** Contracted HCPNs must establish a **"patient records management system with an an interoperable electronic medical record in all member health facilities capable of real-time information-sharing"**. The phrase "interoperable electronic medical record in all member health facilities capable of real-time information-sharing" is a mandate for an HIE function within the HCPN.
- **Accessible Patient Records:** A core function of the Primary Care Provider Network (PCPN), which is the foundation of the HCPN, is to **"enable patient records to be accessible throughout the health system"**.
- **Harmonized ICT and Coordination:** All HCPNs must have **"harmonized information and communication technology"** and functional **"patient navigation and coordination system[s]"**. The iHIS system is specifically required to **"operationalize an ICT-enabled, integrated, and functional referral system within the P/CWHS"** to link PCPN members to secondary and tertiary care providers.
- **Required Core Modules:** The Integrated Health Information System (iHIS) mandated for all healthcare providers (which form the HCPNs) must include **electronic health/medical records** and a **referral system management** module. These components ensure that the movement of patient data necessary for referrals and coordination is handled electronically.

### 2. Guidance for Building the Local HIE Technology

The DOH and PhilHealth provide explicit guidance and enforcement mechanisms to ensure local systems are built to exchange data, confirming that a functional local network structure is a requirement:

- **Standards Conformance and Validation (SCIV):** All health information systems implemented by health care providers (HCPN members) must undergo and pass **SCIV** to verify conformance with **national health data standards for interoperability**. This process ensures that locally-developed systems are technically capable of communicating within the broader ecosystem, including the National Health Data Repository (NHDR).
- **iHIS Implementation Model (iHISIM):** The implementation of an iHIS at the HCPN level follows a phased approach (3 stages over 36 months) with defined cumulative capabilities. Stage 3 requires the local **iHIS [to] integrate with the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE)**. The PHIE is the national interoperability component, which the NHDR supports.
- **Right to Select Systems (Local Empowerment):** LGUs and facilities have the right to select or develop their own HIS/EMR/EHR provider based on their needs. However, this local decision-making is strictly contingent upon the system receiving **certification conforming to the national health data standards for interoperability**. This mechanism ensures local technological empowerment while mandating network compatibility.
- **LHS Maturity Levels (LHS ML):** Progress is tracked in the **Information Track** of the LHS ML, where Stage 3 requires a **"Validated electronic medical record (EMR) system that links the members of the PCPNs to secondary and tertiary care providers"**. This ties the functionality of the local digital network directly to the official measure of integration success.

### Summary

You are right that the explicit term "Local HIE" or "HCPN HIE" may not be used in the core policy documents. However, the legal and operational mandates imposed on HCPNs—specifically concerning **interoperability**, **real-time information sharing**, **accessible patient records throughout the network**, and the required implementation of an **iHIS** that conforms to **SCIV standards** and integrates with the **PHIE**—mean that **HCPNs are fundamentally required to operate using HIE technology and are guided in doing so by the DOH and PhilHealth.**
