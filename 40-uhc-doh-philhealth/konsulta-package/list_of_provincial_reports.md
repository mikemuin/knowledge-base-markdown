# List of Provincial Reports

To manage the status of the **Konsulta Package** for a province, several types of reports and data are needed, covering service delivery, financing, health system performance, and specific program monitoring. These reports help assess implementation, track progress, identify gaps, and inform policy and planning at the provincial level.

Here are the key kinds of reports needed:

- **Konsulta-Specific Utilization and Availment Reports**:
  - **Electronic Konsulta Availment Slips (eKAS)** and **Electronic Prescription Slips (ePresS)**: These are generated by PhilHealth-accredited Konsulta providers for every patient encounter to document consultations, health screenings, assessments, and medicine dispensing. They serve as proof of service and medicine availment. While generated at the provider level, this data is crucial for aggregated provincial reporting.
  - **Filipino Registration Data to Primary Care Providers (PCPs)**: This data includes the number of Filipinos registered to a PCP within each city and municipality. Local Government Units (LGUs), with assistance from the Department of Health (DOH) and PhilHealth, are responsible for registering their constituents and maintaining a master list of their catchment population. This information is used for planning, budgeting, and designing health programs.
  - **Administrative Data from Konsulta Providers**: PhilHealth-accredited Konsulta providers are required to make this data available to PhilHealth for monitoring purposes.
- **Financial Management Reports for Special Health Funds (SHF)**:
  - **Special Health Fund (SHF) Financial Status and Physical Accomplishments Reports**: The Management Support Unit (MSU) assisting the Provincial/City Health Board (P/CHB) is responsible for preparing and submitting these reports, detailing how funds allocated for health services are utilized.
  - **SHF Budget Accountability Forms (Nos. 1 & 2)**: These are specific quarterly and annual reports detailing the utilization of the SHF.
  - **P/CHB Board Resolution on SHF Budget**: A resolution from the P/CHB is required to authorize and approve the SHF budget and its utilization, with copies furnished to the DOH and PhilHealth.
  - **Certifications for SHF Accounts**: These include certifications from authorized government depository banks regarding the SHF bank account (including signatories) and from the Provincial/City Accountant for separate SHF books of account and subsidiary ledgers for each fund source. Subsidiary ledgers for SHF in the Trust Fund of component LGUs also require certification.
  - **Fund Utilization Reports (FUR)**: For any funds transferred, these reports are submitted to the Center for Health Development (CHD) Accountant/Budget Officers.
- **Health System Performance and Monitoring Reports**:
  - **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML) Progress Reports**: This framework monitors the progress of local health system integration into Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). It assesses various Key Result Areas (KRAs) using specific documentary evidences (Means of Verification or MOVs) and includes a P/CWHS Annual Accomplishment Report that reflects health service delivery, health systems performance, health statistics, available health resources, and comparative performance analysis.
  - **LGU Health Scorecard (HSC) Web-based System Reports**: This is a primary tool for assessing and monitoring LGU performance in implementing local health reforms towards Universal Health Care (UHC). It uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and reflects consolidated results of inputs, outputs, processes, and structures related to health reforms. Data from primary care facilities are collected and validated at municipal, provincial, and regional levels.
  - **Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) and Local Investment Plans for Health (LIPH)**: While these are plans, their development, approval, and the status of investment needs (including corresponding fund requirements) are reported at various stages to the DOH for consideration in their budget proposals.
  - **Health Promotion and Literacy Programs Annual Reports**: DOH and DepEd (and LGUs to DILG) submit these reports, which assess the impact of their respective health promotion and literacy programs. These programs are a fundamental component of UHC.
  - **Annual Provincial Burden of Disease (BOD) Estimates**: The DOH is mandated to publish these annually to support LGUs in tracking health outcomes.
  - **Online Health Facility Statistical Reporting System (OHSRS) / Annual Hospital Statistical Report (Annex E Form)**: This system automates the collection of hospital reports nationwide and is required for license renewal. It provides data on the functionality and quality of public and private health facilities, including inpatient and outpatient statistics. This data is relevant for broader Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs) that include Konsulta providers.
  - **National Health Workforce Registry (NHWR) Reports**: These reports provide up-to-date data on the number and location of human resources for health (HRH) practitioners nationwide. Specific reports related to HRH include HRH to population ratios, trained HRH, attrition rates, and patient/HRH satisfaction concerning HRH support.
  - **Health Information System Assessment Reports**: These include baseline assessments, gaps analyses, and identified investment needs for health information management and ICT systems. Specific reports cover security incidents and telemedicine services.
  - **Medical Products, Vaccines, & Technologies Assessment Reports**: These reports cover baseline assessments, gaps analyses, and identified investment needs for procurement and supply chain management. They include information on the availability of essential medicines (stock-outs) and near-expiry medicines.
  - **Service Delivery Assessment Reports**: These reviews cover existing referral systems, service capabilities, and available health services. Specific reports provide rates of coordinated referrals, leading causes of referrals, reasons for declined referrals, and patient satisfaction ratings on service delivery.
  - **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health (DRRM-H) System Assessment Reports**: These include baseline assessments, gaps analyses, and identified investment needs. Reports cover program accomplishments, field health emergency alerting, rapid health assessments, and post-incident evaluations.
  - **Geographically-Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA) Profiling Tool/Information System Reports**: These identify and validate GIDA barangays, analyze gaps in health service delivery, HRH, facilities, medicines, and social health insurance, and identify priority areas and their needs. The DOH issues an official GIDA list annually.
  - **Health Facility Profiling of DOH and PhilHealth**: All participating health facilities are required to comply annually with this profiling.
  - **Electronic Drug Price Monitoring System (EDPMS) Reports**: This system monitors compliance with the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) and Maximum Wholesale Price (MWP) for medicines, including price and inventory information from drug establishments and outlets.
  - **Health Care Provider Performance Assessment System Reports**: PhilHealth uses this system to monitor accredited facilities and healthcare professionals and requires administrative data from Konsulta providers for this purpose.

These reports, when systematically collected and analyzed, provide a comprehensive view of the Konsulta Package's status and broader UHC implementation at the provincial level.
