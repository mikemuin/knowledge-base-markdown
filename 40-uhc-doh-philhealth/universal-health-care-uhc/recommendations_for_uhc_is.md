# Recommendations for UHC-IS

Based on the evaluation of Health Information Systems (HIS) progress across selected Universal Health Care Integrated Sites (UHC-IS), the key conclusions and corresponding recommendations are detailed below.

## Key Conclusions

The report concludes that while progress has been made, systemic issues related to fragmentation, funding, and workforce capacity continue to hinder the realization of Universal Health Care (UHC) objectives.

### HIS as Essential Infrastructure and Fragmentation

- **HIS is the essential infrastructure of trust** that allows UHC to function by ensuring health data are timely, accurate, and actionable.
- The implementation of HIS faces **significant operational challenges**, with systems remaining largely fragmented across the surveyed sites. No facility has successfully implemented a single, **fully interoperable system**.
- There is a **proliferation of multiple systems** (e.g., iClinicSys, iHOMIS, PhilHealth’s eClaims, interim eKonsulta, and even Google Forms) implemented concurrently at the local level.
- This overlap creates a significant **burden on healthcare workers**, who routinely have to use multiple systems, often requiring **double or triple encoding** of the same information.

### Implementation and Workflow

- A persistent implementation characteristic is the reliance on **"back encoding,"** where staff collect data on paper forms first and then transfer the information to digital systems later. This has become a standard workflow due to multiple factors: lack of manpower, human resources spread too thinly, and the prioritization of patient care over paperwork.
- Utilization of government-developed systems like *iClinicSys* remains low; no surveyed site recorded patient registrations for at least 50% of its population.

### Standards and Interoperability

- **Interoperability remains a key challenge** across all selected integration sites.
- The Department of Health (DOH) and PhilHealth have adopted the **Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) framework** for UHC architecture. However, the governance of the critical interoperability layer remains unclear.
- Current PhilHealth electronic claims systems rely on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) but **are not compliant with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards**. The failure to adopt FHIR standards risks creating a fragmented ecosystem where custom development is required for every system integration, increasing complexity and cost.

### Workforce and Financing

- The **lack of Human Resources for Health (HRH), particularly in HIS**, is one of the most pressing issues across all sites.
- Most ICT personnel are employed under **contractual or job order arrangements**. The inability to create permanent plantilla positions is often due to the **Personal Services (PS) limitation** on local government budgets.
- Stakeholders generally **do not receive incentives** from PhilHealth for incorporating HIS, despite this being mandated by the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the UHC Act. Some stakeholders are unaware that such incentivization exists.

## Key Recommendations

The report provides both priority (short-term) and critical policy (medium- to long-term) recommendations, organized across the seven eHealth building blocks.

### Priority Recommendations (Immediate Action)

These actions are considered "low hanging fruit" that can be implemented immediately to accelerate digital health transformation.

| Area                         | Recommendation                                               | Stakeholders          | Source |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------ |
| **Leadership & Governance**  | Require **cabinet-level participation** in inter-agency steering committees, or designate alternates with clear written authority to make binding decisions. | DOH, DICT, PhilHealth |        |
| **Strategy & Investment**    | Secure **dedicated HIS budget lines** within DOH and PhilHealth appropriations for 2026 onwards to ensure sustained financing. | DOH, DBM              |        |
| **Strategy & Investment**    | **Finalize and operationalize the National Digital Health Strategy (NDHS)** with detailed HIS-specific components, standards, and interoperability frameworks to guide LGUs. | DOH, DICT             |        |
| **LGU Institutionalization** | Institutionalize HIS at the LGU level by requiring **EMR roadmaps** and establishing **HIS Committees** within Local Health Boards (LHBs) and Local Investment Plans for Health (LIPH). | DOH, DILG             |        |
| **Financing/Compliance**     | **Link PhilHealth reimbursements** explicitly to HIS adoption and accreditation, thereby embedding HIS as a core requirement for financing. | PhilHealth            |        |

### Critical Policy Recommendations (Sustainability and Legislation)

These recommendations focus on providing the statutory, financial, and institutional backbone necessary to protect HIS reforms from political turnover.

- **Legislation and Policy:**
  - Pass an **eHealth/Digital Health Law** to provide statutory backing for the governance structure, core data sets, foundational standards (like FHIR), and the conformance pathway for interoperability.
  - Adopt a Congressional Resolution urging the President to issue an **Executive Order (EO)** to fast-track EMR deployment and interoperability roll-out, setting firm timelines and accountable leads while legislation is pending.
  - DOH should **prioritize investment and deployment of foundational registries** (terminology services, client registry, health facility registry, health worker registry, and product catalogue) articulated in the OpenHIE framework.
  - PhilHealth should establish a firm timeline to **discontinue the interim eKonsulta solution** and accelerate the accreditation of EMR providers compliant with PhilHealth data requirements.
- **Workforce:**
  - Create **permanent plantilla positions for digital health teams** (e.g., Chief Information Officers—CIOs) in hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs) to oversee implementation and provide sustained daily technical support.
  - DOH, DILG, and DBM should review how the DOH National Health Workforce Support System can be utilized to deploy IT personnel to LGUs, leveraging the Local Infrastructure Program for Health (LIPH) to bypass the current Personnel Services cap limitation.
- **Incentives and Compliance:**
  - Implement **PhilHealth incentives and disincentives** (e.g., linking payment speed or differentials) to reward **real-time, standards-compliant EMR use** and mandate the **exclusive use of interoperable EMRs** (i.e., eliminating parallel non-interoperable systems).
  - Reinforce LGU compliance with DILG Memorandum Circular 2024-135, which mandates the **appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs)** and the registration of Data Processing Systems (DPSes) with the National Privacy Commission Registration System (NPCRS).
