# Universal Health Care (UHC) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

### I. Introduction (3 minutes)

- **Slide 1: Title & Overview**
  - **Universal Health Care (UHC) Mandate:** The UHC Law (Republic Act 11223), enacted in February 2019, establishes a framework to ensure that all citizens have equitable access to quality healthcare services.
  - **The Role of HIS:** To support this goal, the UHC Law mandates the development of robust Health Information Systems (HIS). The successful implementation of HIS is seen as the **essential infrastructure of trust** that allows UHC to function efficiently.
  - **Focus:** This presentation will detail the specific requirements for Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) under UHC and discuss the real-world implications of their adoption or lack thereof.

### II. Requirements of Universal Health Care Concerning Electronic Medical Records (12 minutes)

- **Slide 2: The EMR Mandate and Core Components**
  - The UHC Law explicitly mandates that HIS must include **Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)**. EMRs are defined as a digital version of a patient's chart.
  - EMRs are part of a larger system that also requires Electronic Prescription Logs (EPLs), Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.
  - The primary function of these integrated systems is to enable the **efficient management of patient records, streamline healthcare service delivery, and facilitate evidence-based decision-making**.
- **Slide 3: The Critical Requirement: Interoperability**
  - The UHC Law identifies **interoperability** as a critical objective. EMRs and associated HIS components are expected to be interoperable, enabling **seamless data exchange** across platforms such as iClinicSys, iHOMIS, and PhilHealth’s eClaims system.
  - Interoperability is crucial for supporting the **continuity of care** and efficient resource management across healthcare facilities.
  - The goal is to move away from fragmented data systems that disrupt continuity of care.
- **Slide 4: Foundational Standards for EMR Compliance**
  - To ensure true interoperability, the **Mandatory Adoption and Use of National Health Data Standards for Interoperability** (JAO 2021-0002) is required.
  - Key foundational registries and standards mandated for data exchange include:
    - **Client Identifier:** Use of the PhilHealth ID number or the PSA’s National ID for unique patient identification.
    - **Messaging Standard:** **Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)**, an international standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically.
    - **Clinical Terminology:** **SNOMED-CT** (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms) for standardized medical documentation.
  - Compliance with these standards is monitored through the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework.
- **Slide 5: EMRs and Financial Requirements**
  - PhilHealth is directed to incentivize the incorporation and integration of health information systems.
  - EMR systems must integrate with PhilHealth’s **eClaims submission system**.
  - It is recommended that PhilHealth **link quality metrics** (e.g., compliance with national practice guidelines, chronic disease management) to EMR-based evidence, aligning financing with both clinical compliance and improved health outcomes.

### III. Implications of EMR Adoption vs. Non-Adoption with UHC (12 minutes)

- **Slide 6: The Benefits of Successful EMR Adoption (The Ideal State)**
  - **Data-Driven Governance:** Strong and sustainable HIS ensures health data are **timely, accurate, and actionable**, enabling better policy decisions and resource allocation.
  - **Improved Outcomes:** Integrated systems improve health outcomes by enabling better data coordination and resource allocation.
  - **Financial Efficiency:** A fully functional HIS helps ensure **strong and interconnected referral systems** and **expedites financial claims and hospital reimbursements** from PhilHealth.
  - **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Across all surveyed sites, stakeholders (owners, implementers, and health workers) uniformly agreed that HIS is either **"very relevant" or "relevant"** in achieving UHC goals (100% agreement among these groups).
- **Slide 7: The Reality of Non-Adoption and Fragmented Implementation (The Challenges)**
  - **Lack of Interoperability:** Interoperability remains a **key challenge** across all selected integration sites. For instance, referrals and patient history are often **still paper-based** between health centers and hospitals.
  - **System Fragmentation:** There is a proliferation of **multiple systems** (e.g., iClinicSys, iHOMIS, Google Forms, private EMRs) implemented concurrently, which suggests the need for a standardized system.
  - **Provider Burden:** Healthcare workers routinely face the burden of **using multiple systems**, often requiring **double or even triple encoding** of the same information. This is due partly to the lack of interoperable systems.
  - **Reliance on Paper:** Many facilities continue to use **paper-based systems** due to financial constraints leading to inadequate equipment and poor internet connectivity. A standard workaround observed is **"back encoding,"** where staff collect data on paper first, then transfer it later to digital systems.
- **Slide 8: Workforce and Financial Hurdles (Barriers to Adoption)**
  - **Workforce Gaps:** The **lack of human resources** for health, particularly in HIS, is a pressing issue across all sites. Most ICT personnel are hired under contractual or job order arrangements, resulting in **high turnover** and difficulty sustaining systems. Staff often have to perform high-level ICT tasks beyond their skills and pay grade.
  - **Funding Disparity:** Financial constraints result in inadequate IT infrastructure. Although PhilHealth is mandated to incentivize HIS, stakeholders reported they **do not receive the said incentives**, and some are even unaware of incentivization.
  - **Impact on Patients:** The lack of interoperability and data duplication (such as inconsistent PhilHealth ID numbers) leads to a persistent problem of **claim rejections and reimbursement concerns**.
- **Slide 9: Consequences of Failing to Adopt Standards**
  - Current PhilHealth e-claims systems often use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) but are **not compliant with the standardized FHIR** messaging standard.
  - The failure to adopt FHIR standards risks creating a **proliferation of multiple non-standard API endpoints**, meaning that each system integration requires custom development work. This significantly **increases development costs and complexity** while reducing system reliability and data consistency.

### IV. Conclusion and Key Recommendations (3 minutes)

- **Slide 10: Summary of Key Takeaways**
  - The UHC Law fundamentally requires **interoperable EMRs** anchored in national standards like FHIR and SNOMED-CT.
  - Implementation remains challenged by **fragmented systems, severe HR shortages**, and insufficient funding/infrastructure, forcing reliance on paper and double-encoding.
  - Effective HIS implementation is essential for realizing UHC goals of equitable, efficient, and transparent health services.
- **Slide 11: Priority Actions for Strengthening EMR Implementation**
  - **Cabinet-Level Leadership:** Require cabinet-level participation in inter-agency steering committees to ensure policy continuity and enforcement.
  - **Dedicated Financing:** Secure **dedicated HIS budget lines** within DOH and PhilHealth appropriations.
  - **Incentivize Compliance:** **Link PhilHealth reimbursements to HIS adoption** and standards-compliant EMR use.
  - **Workforce Development:** Create **permanent digital health positions** (plantilla items) in hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs) to oversee EMR support and implementation.
