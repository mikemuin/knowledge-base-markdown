# Secret Strategies to Successful EMR Implementations

Strategic Approaches for Healthcare Organizations

By Dr. Mike Muin

------

## Introduction

- **EMR Definition:** Electronic record of health-related information that can be created, gathered, managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians within one healthcare organization
- **Main Goal:** Realize substantial benefits for physicians, healthcare staff, and patients
- **Reality:** EMR implementations are difficult, challenging, and fraught with failures
- **Secret:** Approach implementation strategically with eyes and mind wide open for uncommon insights

------

## The Core Challenge

- **Conventional Thinking:** Failed EMR projects are failed IT projects
- **The Missing Holes:** Like Abraham Wald's bomber analysis, we must study what we don't see
- **Strategic Approach:** Study the 'missing holes' of failed EMR implementations
- **Key Insight:** Look beyond obvious technical failures to understand deeper causes

------

## The Strategic Mindset

- **Master Concept:** EMR projects are NOT IT projects - they are socio-technical projects that impact organizational processes and user behaviors
- **Ultimate Goal:** Not to install software, but to change behavior, culture, and the organization
- **Strategic Awareness:** Be vigilant of various causes of failures that are not technical
- **Critical Focus:** Understand sociological forces at play in each implementation

------

## Three Strategic Questions

- **Expect Failures:** What kind of errors and failures should I expect?
- **Study Social Components:** What social components and interactions are at play?
- **Understand Decision-Making:** How are decisions made and implemented?

These questions put you into a strategic mindset essential for project success.

------

## Expect Failures

- **Reality Check:** No such thing as a perfect project plan
- **Complex Nature:** EMR projects are so complex that wrong assumptions are inevitable
- Essential Elements:
  - Institute a culture where failures can be reported easily
  - Install feedback mechanisms for tracking potential risks
  - Build strong implementation teams that can respond immediately

------

## Key Failure Questions

- Which task would be the most common cause of failure at this step?
- What would failure START to look like?
- What would failure ULTIMATELY look like?
- Which user group would be the first to notice errors?
- Are users empowered and equipped to report failures?
- Is IT well-trained to respond and resolve expected failures?

------

## Study Social Components

- **Rich Sources:** Social components are sources of challenges, conflicts, and failures
- Key Elements:
  - Key influential persons (including those not in formal power positions)
  - Social interactions and collective opinions of groups
  - Formal and informal communication methods and styles
- **Proactive Approach:** Identify project champions and influential allies early

------

## Social Component Questions

- Who are the key opinion leaders in each stakeholder group?
- Which groups are obvious supporters vs. need convincing?
- Which groups could provide the most challenge if against the initiative?
- What are the unspoken rules and norms in interactions?
- How is information spread across departments and groups?

------

## Understand Decision-Making

- **Key Driver:** Decisions move the project forward at each step
- **Critical Role:** Decisions are key to solving socio-technical challenges
- **Cultural Impact:** Organizational culture affects how decisions are made and implemented
- **Reality:** Projects don't flow naturally - there are many starts and stops driven by decisions

------

## Decision-Making Questions

- Who are the key decision makers in each stage?
- How do these key people make decisions?
- What supporting data do decision makers respond to?
- How do people respond to decisions - act immediately, wait, or ignore?
- What are the informal rules about decisions in the organization?

## Success Requirements Framework

**Strategic Insight:** In EMR projects, success factors are not just contributory factors - they form part of the requirements of the project. In many instances, success factors should become projects themselves.

------

## The 10 Success Requirements

- **Financial and Other Resources**
- **Technical Requirements**
- **Vendor Engagement**
- **Change Management Process**
- **User Ownership**
- **Training**
- **IT Governance**
- **Physician Champions**
- **Organizational Leadership**
- **Organizational Culture**

------

## Financial and Other Resources

- Three Critical Factors:
  - The ability to pay for prescribed budget
  - The ability to go beyond budget
  - The willingness to go beyond budget
- Common Budget Overruns:
  - Training budget underestimation
  - IT Infrastructure constraints
  - Unforeseen hardware needs
  - Additional staff requirements

------

## Technical Requirements

- **Foundation Elements:** Servers, software, workstations, Internet, LAN, access points
- Three Critical Technical Factors:
  - Speed, Performance, and Usability
  - Availability and Access
  - Integration
- **Key Principle:** Technical problems are easiest to get right and fastest to resolve - there's no excuse for long-term technical failures

------

## Vendor Engagement

- Three Crucial Factors:
  - Track record (especially of team members)
  - Focus on results (not just time and effort)
  - Focus on solving problems (acting as true partners)
- **Partnership Mindset:** Excellent vendors help hospitals solve problems and view organizations as partners in the journey

------

## Change Management Process

- **Agile Approach Required:** Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
- **Why Agile Thinking:** Despite due diligence, there will be plenty of unknowns and wrong assumptions
- Key Process:
  - Make assumptions based on available data
  - Create project plan
  - Test assumptions early
  - Learn and adjust
  - Repeat

------

## User Ownership

- **Beyond Engagement:** Users should OWN the system, not just be involved
- **Ownership Means:** Users hold themselves accountable for project outcome
- **Shift in Accountability:** When users own the system, accountability shifts from IT to users
- **Signs of Ownership:** Users engage IT, demand results, proactively give feedback

------

## Training Strategy

- **Key Principle:** Training is a continuous process, not a single event
- Three Levels of Learning:
  - Level 1: Awareness (broad overview)
  - Level 2: Knowledge and Understanding (deeper learning)
  - Level 3: Application/On-the-Job Training (building proficiency)
- **Best Practice:** Err on the side of overtraining

------

## IT Governance

- **Secret Purpose:** The true purpose of IT governance is to challenge the status quo
- **Core Functions:** Think, Decide, and Communicate
- Essential Tasks:
  - Think: Data gathering, problem analysis, stakeholder consultation
  - Decide: Set priorities, change policies, create action plans
  - Communicate: Ensure decisions gain traction within organization

------

## Physician Champions

- **Main Role:** Lead change among physicians
- Multiple Responsibilities:
  - Advocate and promote project
  - Act as liaison between IT and clinicians
  - Navigate medical practice complexities
  - Represent medical group interests
  - Analyze clinical data and feedback
  - Train and guide fellow doctors

------

## Effective Physician Champions

- Ideal Qualities:
  - Strong leadership skills
  - Well-respected with extensive networks
  - Understand reasons for change
  - Think strategically about action plans
  - Excellent communication skills
  - Full support from medical and organizational leadership
- **Avoid:** Techie doctors or outsiders without hospital culture knowledge

------

## Organizational Leadership

- Three Requirements:
  - Send clear message of support
  - Respect the IT governance process
  - Own the project
- **Key Message:** Project is top priority and critical to hospital's future
- **Ownership Concept:** Hospital leaders see project success and hospital future as intertwined goals

------

## Organizational Culture

- **Strategic Truth:** Culture determines results
- **Impact:** Culture dictates beliefs, actions, and behaviors, thus impacting project results
- Four Cultural Responses:
  - Support (best response)
  - Allow (lukewarm, needs conversion to support)
  - Delay (passive-aggressive behavior)
  - Resist (active opposition)

------

## Negative Cultures to Combat

- **Culture of Blame/Fear:** Low tolerance for failures, excessive finger-pointing
- **Turf Culture:** Departments protect territories at project's expense
- **Culture of Mediocrity:** "Good enough" mentality with no appetite for advancement
- **Solution:** Build positive counter-cultures of accountability, collaboration, and excellence within project teams

------

## The Strategic Battle Plan

**Sun Tzu's Wisdom:** "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."

- **The 'General':** Project leaders with strategic mindset
- **The 'Enemy':** Multitude of socio-technical forces (the success requirements)
- **The Strategy:** Success requirements are not optional - they form part of project requirements

------
