## Briefing Document: DOH Plans on Road Safety

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (based on latest DOH annual report)
**Subject:** DOH Initiatives and Plans for Road Safety within the Universal Health Care (UHC) Framework

**1. Strategic Alignment and Policy Framework**
Road safety is a critical component of the Department of Health's broader agenda under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act. It is explicitly integrated within the **Health Promotion Framework Strategy (HPFS)** and the **8-Point Action Agenda**, which serve as the DOH's medium-term strategy [1-6].

*   **Priority Area:** Road safety falls under **"Violence and Injury Prevention,"** one of the seven priority areas for action outlined in the HPFS. This area aims to protect communities from both intentional and unintentional injuries [2, 3, 7].
*   **8-Point Action Agenda:** The **"Pag-iwas sa sakit"** (disease prevention and health promotion) action agenda directly incorporates efforts to enable the adoption of healthy behaviors across these seven priority areas, including Violence and Injury Prevention [2, 3].
*   **Health-Enabling Environments:** Promoting healthy behaviors also includes fostering **"Infrastructure and public spaces that promote mobility and safe road use"** [8]. The HPFS aims to integrate health considerations into people's living, learning, and working environments [9].

**2. Targets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
The DOH has set clear targets to reduce the burden of road traffic injuries:

*   **Baseline (2020):** The death rate due to road traffic injuries was **8.0 per 100,000 population** [7, 10].
*   **2028 Target:** As per the National Objectives for Health (NOH) 2023-2028, the target is to reduce the death rate due to road traffic injuries to **4.80 per 100,000 population** [10].
*   **2030 Target (SDG Alignment):** The long-term target is to further reduce this rate to **4.0 per 100,000 population**, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of reducing such deaths by half [7].
*   **Data Sources:** Progress will be monitored using data from Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) [10].

**3. Key Interventions and Approaches**
The DOH advocates for a comprehensive and integrated approach to road safety:

*   **Integrated Safe System Approach:** This is identified as a "Best Buy Intervention" under Violence and Injury Prevention. It is anchored in several crucial components [7]:
    *   **Speed management** [7]
    *   **Leadership on road safety** [7]
    *   **Infrastructure design and improvement** [7]
    *   **Vehicle safety standards** [7]
    *   **Enforcement of traffic laws** [7]
    *   **Survival after a crash** (which includes effective post-crash care and emergency response) [7, 11].
*   **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in Health (DRRM-H):** The institutionalization of DRRM-H systems at the province-wide and city-wide health system (P/CWHS) level aims to ensure timely, effective, and efficient preparedness and response to public health emergencies and disasters, including those that might result from road accidents. Key components of a functional DRRM-H system include equipped ambulances or patient transport vehicles [11-13].
*   **National Environmental Health Action Plan 2030:** This plan directs intersectoral efforts to address environmental health challenges, which can encompass aspects of road safety through urban planning and sustainable transport initiatives, although specific road safety measures are not detailed under this plan in the sources [14].

**4. Responsible Agencies and Coordination**
The DOH plays a central stewardship role, working in coordination with various stakeholders:

*   **Department of Health (DOH):** Responsible for formulating the HPFS, setting targets, developing guidelines, and providing technical support for health promotion and injury prevention, including road safety [1, 15].
*   **Health Promotion Bureau (HPB):** Leads the formulation of the HPFS and developing playbooks to guide regional counterparts and Local Government Units (LGUs) in implementing health promotional activities and programs, including those for violence and injury prevention [1, 16].
*   **Local Government Units (LGUs):** Are directed to enact stricter ordinances that strengthen existing health promotion policies and programs [17]. They are also key in implementing DRRM-H plans within their respective Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS) [12, 13].

In summary, DOH's plans on road safety are embedded within its broader health promotion and injury prevention strategies. The focus is on reducing road traffic injury-related deaths through a multi-faceted Safe System Approach, clear targets, and intersectoral collaboration, aiming to create safer environments and more resilient health systems.
