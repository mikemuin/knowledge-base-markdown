# Secret Strategies to Successful EMR Implementations

## Strategic Approaches for Healthcare Organizations

------

## Introduction

- **EMR Definition:** Electronic record of health-related information created, gathered, managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians within one healthcare organization
- **Global Context:** Worldwide digital transformation in healthcare, regulatory compliance needs, interoperability requirements
- **Implementation Challenges:** High failure rates, technical complexities, cultural resistance, resource constraints
- **Target Audience:** Project managers, CIOs, CMIOs, hospital administrators, healthcare IT leaders

------

## The Strategic Mindset

- **Core Principle:** EMR projects are NOT IT projects - they are socio-technical projects that impact organizational processes and user behaviors
- **Ultimate Goal:** Not to install software, but to change behavior, culture, and organization
- **Healthcare Reality:** Diverse organizational structures, varying technological readiness, cultural sensitivities, regulatory requirements
- **Success Formula:** Strategic thinking + Understanding organizational context + Managing human factors

------

## Three Strategic Questions

- Expect Failures:
  - What kind of errors and failures should I expect?
  - How can we create a culture of transparency and quick response?
- Study Social Components:
  - What social components and interactions are at play?
  - Who are the influencers, supporters, and potential resistors?
- Understand Decision-Making Process:
  - How are decisions made and implemented?
  - What are the formal and informal power structures?
