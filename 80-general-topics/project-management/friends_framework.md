# FRIENDS Framework for Requirements Gathering

## Overview
The FRIENDS (or FINDERS) framework is an adaptation of SAP's RICEF model, designed to gather comprehensive data and business requirements. It provides a structured approach for capturing all aspects of business processes, system requirements, and implementation requirements.

## Core Components

   - Form workflows
   - Approval processes
   - Storage and retrieval procedures
   - Compliance requirements
2. **System Forms Implementation**
   - Paper to digital transformation
   - System-embedded forms
   - Custom form development

### R - Reports
**Definition:** All output mechanisms for data analysis and presentation
- Administrative reports
- Performance metrics
- Financial reporting
- System-embedded reports
- Data exports

### I - Integration/Interfaces
**Definition:** All system interconnections and data exchange points
