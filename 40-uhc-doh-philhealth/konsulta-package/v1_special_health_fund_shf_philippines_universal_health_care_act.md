# Special Health Fund (SHF) - Philippines Universal Health Care Act

The **Special Health Fund (SHF)** is a critical financial mechanism under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act in the Philippines, designed to ensure a more strategic, efficient, and equitable pooling and management of health resources at the local level. It addresses the fragmentation in health financing, promotes the integration of local health systems, and aims to improve equity in access to health services.

## Legal Basis and Purpose

The UHC Act (Republic Act No. 11223), enacted in 2019, paved the way for significant health system reforms, including the institutionalization of the SHF. Section 20 of the UHC Act mandates that province-wide or city-wide health systems (P/CWHS) shall **pool and manage all resources intended for health services through an SHF**.

The creation of the SHF is aimed at reducing fragmentation in health financing, promoting the integration of local health systems, and improving equitable access to health services. It also provides appropriate incentives and financing mechanisms to achieve and sustain managerial, technical, and financial integration, while ensuring transparency and proper accountability in the use of health resources.

The UHC Act specifically required P/CWHS to exhibit **managerial integration** within the first three years from its enactment and **financial integration** within the subsequent three years. The SHF is central to achieving this financial integration.

## Sources of Funds

The SHF pools various financial resources intended for health services. These sources include:

- **Financial grants and subsidies from national government agencies**, particularly the Department of Health (DOH). These can be transferred through Terms of Partnership (TOP) agreements.
- **Income from PhilHealth payments** of LGU-owned and -managed health offices, facilities, and services. PhilHealth payments accrue to the SHF and are credited to the annual regular income of the LGUs.
- **Other sources** such as financial grants and donations from Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Faith-Based Organizations, Official Development Assistance (ODA), and international health partners.
- **LGUs may also opt to transfer their local budget intended for health** to the SHF through cooperative undertakings. This contribution is optional, but if chosen, it must be covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the component LGUs and the Provincial Health Board.

## Allowable Uses of the SHF

As determined and approved by the Provincial or City Health Board (P/CHB), the SHF can be allocated for a comprehensive range of health-related expenditures:

### Population-based and Individual-based Health Services

This includes environmental health services (e.g., vector control, water quality, sanitation), health promotion programs and campaigns, disease elimination services, epidemiological and disease surveillance, and preparedness and response to public health emergencies or disasters. For individual-based services, it covers ambulatory and inpatient care, medicines, laboratory tests and procedures.

### Health System Operating Costs

This includes support for P/CWHS management, learning and development (capacity building), accreditation and licensing fees, conduct of trainings, seminars, conferences, and conventions relevant to health system management and service delivery. It also covers expenses like fuel for ambulances and patient transport vehicles, and transportation of health commodities and diagnostic specimens.

### Capital Investments

Such as infrastructure, equipment, and information technology. This can include improvements to health facilities, health equipment and instruments, IT for health facilities, ambulances, patient transport vehicles, and mobile clinics.

### Remuneration and Incentives

Remuneration of additional health workers and incentives for all health workers. This aligns with relevant laws like RA 7305 (Magna Carta for Public Health Workers) and RA 7883 (BHW Benefits and Incentives Act).

## Management and Accountability

The **Provincial Health Board (PHB) and City Health Board (CHB) assume full responsibility** for the management of the SHF, adhering to existing budgeting, accounting, and auditing rules and regulations. They are tasked with ensuring optimal utilization to achieve desirable health outcomes.

A **Management Support Unit (MSU)** is created under the health board to serve as its administrative secretariat and assist in SHF management, coordination with stakeholders, and financial support functions. The Provincial/City Health Office (P/CHO) serves as the technical secretariat.

The **DOH and PhilHealth require the creation of an SHF** for contracting P/CWHS. LGUs must appropriate counterpart funding through an ordinance for health programs based on their Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH). LGUs transferring control of health resources to the P/CWHS's SHF are entitled to additional financial and non-financial incentives.

The allocation of DOH grants and PhilHealth income from the SHF is based on contractual obligations of the P/CHB with DOH (for population-based services) and PhilHealth (for individual-based services), the LIPH, and SHF guidelines.

### Monitoring and Transparency

The P/CHB must provide DOH and PhilHealth with copies of the LIPH, Annual Operational Plan (AOP), and the P/CHB Resolution detailing SHF expenditures. The DOH and PhilHealth are mandated to establish and maintain an **SHF utilization tracking system** for real-time data collection, consolidation, and analysis. Current systems like e-claims can be used until the dedicated tracking system is created. The utilization of SHF for disallowed items can subject officials to penalties.

An SHF depository bank account is required, along with a separate book of accounts and subsidiary ledgers for each fund source at the provincial, Highly Urbanized City (HUC), and Independent Component City (ICC) levels.

## Current Status and Integration with UHC

The SHF is a component of the **Health Care Financing Strategy of the Philippines 2023-2028**, which outlines the financial roadmap to support UHC Act reforms. This strategy aims to reduce household out-of-pocket expenses and protect Filipinos from financial burdens when accessing health services.

The **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** framework tracks the progress of LGUs in integrating their local health systems into P/CWHS, and includes the creation and use of the SHF as a key result area for financial integration.

As of June 10, 2024, of the 91 UHC Integration Sites, **60 LGUs have established SHF accounts**, with 27 having program funds deposited beyond seed money.

Pilot testing of the SHF is scheduled in **South Cotabato, Quezon, Bataan, and Baguio City**. Funds have been used for procurement of medicines, medical/dental/laboratory supplies and equipment, capacity development of health personnel, health worker incentives, health promotion campaigns, and meetings on P/CWHS integration.

PhilHealth Circular No. 2023-0008 highlights the implementation of Primary Care Provider Network (PCPN) contracting through the Konsulta Package in Sandbox sites, linking it to the SHF.

## Summary

The Special Health Fund acts as the **financial backbone of the integrated local health systems** envisioned by the UHC Act. It's like a community chest where all funds designated for the entire town's well-being are pooled, ensuring that resources are strategically managed and allocated, not just for immediate needs like treating sickness, but also for long-term investments in health infrastructure, preventative programs, and supporting the dedicated health workers who are the frontline guardians of the community's health.
