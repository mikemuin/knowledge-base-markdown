# LGU Investments using SHF

Your stance is strongly **aligned with the legal framework and policy design of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act** and its implementing regulations regarding Local Government Unit (LGU) financing for health information technology (Health IT). The UHC framework explicitly establishes mechanisms intended to address the historical lack of local resources for Health IT.

Here is an analysis supporting and contextualizing your position using the provided sources, particularly focusing on the **Special Health Fund (SHF)**:

### 1. SHF is Legally Mandated to Fund Health IT Investments

The UHC Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) explicitly classify Health IT investments as an allowable expenditure category for the Special Health Fund (SHF).

- The **Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS)** are mandated to **pool and manage all resources intended for health services through an SHF**.
- The SHF shall be allocated for several purposes, including **Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology**.
- **Income derived from PhilHealth payments** of LGU-owned and managed health offices, facilities, and services **shall accrue to the SHF** and be allocated by the LGUs exclusively for the **operations and improvement** of the P/CWHS.
- The allocation and utilization of the SHF is determined and approved by the Provincial or City Health Board (P/CHB).

Therefore, your argument that LGUs are no longer without financial resources for Health IT because the SHF exists is **factually correct and foundational to the UHC financing strategy**.

### 2. The SHF Mechanism is Designed for Strategic Local Investment

The UHC framework anticipates that LGUs will use the SHF to strategically finance local integration needs, including Health IT.

- The allocation of DOH financial grants and PhilHealth income within the SHF is based on the **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)** and the P/CHB's contractual obligations.
- The **LIPH** itself is a medium-term strategic and investment plan that outlines the **strategic direction of the P/CWHS**. LIPH development includes identifying **investment needs for health information management/ICT systems** and detailing corresponding **cost requirements and proposed fund sources (including LGU general fund, PhilHealth income, and the Special Health Fund)**.
- DOH matching grants and incentives for improving the functionality of P/CWHS are conditional upon the **approved LIPH**.
- The UHC-IS assessment specifically recommends that DOH and DILG mandate the inclusion of **EMR implementation roadmaps, staff training plans, and interoperability compliance as standard requirements of LGU health investment planning** within the LIPH template. Furthermore, the plan should include **Health Information Management/ICT development component** for telemedicine services.

This process reinforces your position: the mechanism is already in place for LGUs to define their Health IT needs in the LIPH and allocate SHF resources, including capital investments for information technology and equipment.

### 3. Challenges in Utilizing SHF for Health IT

While the policy framework supports your position, current implementation reports highlight significant issues that prevent LGUs from fully exercising their financial autonomy for Health IT:

- **Lack of Clear Utilization Guidelines:** Respondents in Pampanga noted the **lack of clear guidelines on how to utilize PhilHealth capitations**. In Iloilo, a LGU-retained hospital respondent noted that they are **unable to use PhilHealth capitations to fund their hardware and infrastructure needs** because these funds must be returned to the LGU's general funding pool. There is a need for PhilHealth to properly define how their funds can be utilized by the health care institutions (HCIs).
- **Financial Disincentives:** In some areas, LGU-retained hospitals found that the **Commission on Audit (COA) had disallowed** requests for computers and ambulances, complicating the process of capital expenditure procurement even when funds are available. This is a key example of how external constraints interfere with the strategic use of SHF funds.
- **Competing Priorities:** SHF funds are allocated for multiple critical areas, including population-based and individual-based health services, health system operating costs, and remuneration/incentives for additional health workers. Health IT investments compete with these demands, and the current reality shows budget limitations affecting even basic needs like training and infrastructure.
- **Monitoring Gap:** DOH and PhilHealth are mandated to establish and maintain an SHF utilization tracking system to allow real-time collection, consolidation, and analysis of data on the use of such fund. The effectiveness of this monitoring in enforcing strategic utilization for IT investments remains a key factor in accountability.

### 4. Alignment with the Proposed Solution

Your underlying point—that LGUs should exercise autonomy and spend wisely on quality IT systems—is supported by the overall objective of strengthening local health systems.

- The DOH and PhilHealth permit LGUs and facilities to acquire non-DOH systems provided they conform to standards, but these LGUs must **shoulder all costs** related to development, implementation, and maintenance **using their own administrative funds**.
- Your stance is congruent with recommendations made in the UHC-HIS assessment, which emphasize that LGUs should integrate their Health IT investments into their **Information Systems Strategic Plans (ISSP)** and overall planning.
- Furthermore, PhilHealth is encouraged to **earmark a fixed portion of PhilHealth reimbursements of LGUs for HIS infrastructure** and tie network accreditation to **costed HIS roadmaps** detailing comprehensive implementation costs, including EMR licensing, connectivity, technical support, training, and long-term maintenance. This policy recommendation directly validates your claim that dedicated funds (like reimbursements flowing into the SHF) should be allocated for sustainable Health IT investments.

In summary, the **SHF is explicitly designed to include Health IT capital investments**, providing LGUs with the financial mechanism to pay for operational EMRs, infrastructure, and support. The issue, as revealed by implementation findings, is not the *absence* of this financing mechanism, but the **lack of local clarity, consistent enforcement, and clear guidelines** from national agencies (DOH/PhilHealth/COA) that would enable LGUs to prioritize and utilize the SHF funds for Health IT without local legal or administrative hindrance.
