# 2016 HIMSS EMRAM Stage Goals

| **Stage**   | **Components (2016 EMRAM)**                                  | **What This Stage is Gunning For (Technical & Clinical Objectives)** |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stage 7** | Medical record fully electronic; HIE participation; data analytics; governance; disaster recovery; continuity of care | **Technical:** Achieve enterprise-wide data integration with health information exchange (HIE), analytics, and disaster recovery systems. **Clinical:** Enable secure, coordinated care across organizations, support risk stratification, and ensure care continuity even during system outages. |
| **Stage 6** | CDS with variance detection; structured documentation; full radiology PACS | **Technical:** Deploy advanced CDS and standardized documentation across departments. **Clinical:** Improve consistency of care, detect clinical deviations, and enhance diagnostic decision-making. |
| **Stage 5** | Closed-loop medication admin; barcode/RFID; capability for advanced CDS | **Technical:** Expand automation and ensure accuracy in medication administration using barcoding/RFID. **Clinical:** Eliminate medication errors and promote real-time medication verification. |
| **Stage 4** | CPOE with CDS; lab, radiology and pharmacy systems integrated | **Technical:** Fully integrate ancillary systems with provider order entry and real-time CDS. **Clinical:** Improve decision support during ordering and enhance coordination across diagnostic services. |
| **Stage 3** | Clinical documentation; error checking; some CDS; more departments covered | **Technical:** Expand structured documentation to more units with embedded error-checking. **Clinical:** Improve clinical workflow, reduce preventable errors, and enhance documentation reliability. |
| **Stage 2** | HIE within hospital; CDR active; beginning of CDS            | **Technical:** Enable internal data exchange and build foundational decision support using a clinical data repository. **Clinical:** Allow cross-departmental visibility of patient data to improve collaboration and reduce redundancy. |
| **Stage 1** | Ancillary systems operational; CDR populated                 | **Technical:** Operationalize lab, radiology, and pharmacy systems and begin feeding into a shared CDR. **Clinical:** Make test results and medication data more readily available to improve turnaround and reduce clinical delays. |
| **Stage 0** | Some ancillary systems may be installed; no integration      | **Technical:** Fragmented or siloed IT systems without interoperability. **Clinical:** Disconnected data flows resulting in care delays and inefficiencies. |
