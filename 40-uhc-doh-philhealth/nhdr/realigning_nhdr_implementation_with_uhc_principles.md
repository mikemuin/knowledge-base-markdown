# Realigning NHDR Implementation with UHC Principles

**Policy Position Paper**

------

## Executive Summary

- NHDR must be reimagined as an enabler of Universal Health Care
- Fundamental shift needed: prioritize local health system empowerment
- Align with actual service delivery and financing accountability
- Create genuine clinical value before national aggregation

<div class="notes"> This presentation outlines a critical policy position on the National Health Data Repository and its alignment with Universal Health Care principles. The core argument is straightforward: the NHDR must be reimagined and implemented as an enabler of UHC rather than a parallel national reporting infrastructure. This position calls for a fundamental shift in NHDR governance and implementation strategy—one that prioritizes local health system empowerment, aligns with actual service delivery and financing accountability, and creates genuine clinical value before attempting national aggregation. </div>

------

## Introduction: The UHC Mandate

- Universal Health Care Act: equitable access to quality, affordable health care
- P/CWHS established as integrated service delivery model
- HCPNs operationalize coordination from primary to tertiary care
- NHDR mandated as authoritative repository of health data

<div class="notes"> The Universal Health Care Act represents the Philippines' commitment to ensuring all Filipinos have equitable access to quality, affordable health care services. The law establishes Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems as the integrated service delivery model, operationalized through Health Care Provider Networks that coordinate patient care from primary to tertiary levels. The NHDR, mandated under the UHC Act as the authoritative repository of health data, must serve as the informational backbone that enables these integrated systems to function effectively. </div>

------

## The Core Issue

- NHDR must follow, enable, and implement UHC principles
- Should not operate as separate national data collection exercise
- Cannot bypass health system structures that UHC creates
- Must align with the integrated service delivery model

<div class="notes"> However, the NHDR's design and implementation must follow, enable, and implement UHC principles—not operate as a separate national data collection exercise that bypasses the very health system structures UHC creates. This is the fundamental tension that needs to be addressed. The question is whether the NHDR will truly enable integrated health systems or become another fragmented, top-down reporting burden. </div>

------

## Argument 1: Legal Accountability at P/CWHS Level

**Established Facts from UHC Act:**

- HCPNs responsible for continuum of care delivery
- Must coordinate patient referrals and ensure continuity
- Required to establish interoperable EMR systems with real-time information-sharing
- P/CWHS manage Special Health Fund from DOH and PhilHealth streams

<div class="notes"> The first core argument focuses on where legal accountability resides. The UHC Act establishes clear facts: Health Care Provider Networks are the operational units responsible for delivering the continuum of care. These networks must coordinate patient referrals and ensure continuity of care across levels. Critically, contracted HCPNs are required to establish patient records management systems with interoperable electronic medical records in all member facilities capable of real-time information-sharing. Meanwhile, Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems manage the Special Health Fund, pooling resources from DOH population-based contracts and PhilHealth individual-based service payments. </div>

------

## Argument 1: Legal Accountability (continued)

**Statutory Authority:**

- Provincial and City Health Boards have authority over health facilities
- P/CHBs manage pooled resources through SHF
- Legally designated stewards of integrated health systems

<div class="notes"> Furthermore, Provincial and City Health Boards have statutory authority under the UHC Act over health facilities, manage pooled resources through the SHF, and are the legally designated stewards of integrated health systems in their jurisdictions. This is not opinion—this is the legal structure established by the UHC Act. </div>

------

## Argument 1: Position

**If legal accountability resides at P/CWHS level, then operational HIE capability should also be established at this level**

- Enables entities to fulfill mandated responsibilities
- Data must serve those legally responsible for patient outcomes
- Care coordination is primarily intra-P/CWHS workflow

<div class="notes"> Based on these established facts, my position is clear: If legal accountability for service delivery, fund management, and patient care coordination resides at the P/CWHS level under the UHC Act, then operational health information exchange capability should also be established at this level to enable these entities to fulfill their mandated responsibilities. This is a logical extension of the legal framework, not an arbitrary preference. </div>

------

## Argument 1: The Practical Reality

- Primary clinical workflow: care coordination within patient pathways
- Pregnant woman: rural health unit → district hospital → postpartum care
- Diabetic patient: city health center → city hospital for specialist care
- Emergency patient: arriving unconscious with scattered medical history
- Majority of workflows occur within single P/CWHS

<div class="notes"> Let's consider the practical reality. The primary clinical workflow that requires health information exchange is care coordination within natural patient care pathways. Think about the pregnant woman moving from prenatal care at the rural health unit to delivery at the district hospital and back to postpartum care. Or the diabetic patient referred from the city health center to the city hospital for specialist care. Or the emergency patient arriving unconscious whose medical history is scattered across three facilities. The majority of these care coordination workflows occur within a single P/CWHS because that is how referral networks are geographically and administratively structured under the UHC Act. </div>

------

## Argument 1: The Fundamental Misalignment

**When NHDR extracts data directly from facilities to national repository:**

- Disconnects information flow from legal accountability relationships
- Facilities submit data upward for national purposes
- Cannot share information horizontally with HCPN partners
- Contradicts contractual accountability for coordinated patient care

<div class="notes"> This leads to identification of a fundamental misalignment. When the NHDR is structured to extract data from individual facilities directly to a national repository without first enabling local network exchange, it disconnects information flow from the accountability relationships established by law. Facilities are required to submit data upward for national purposes while remaining unable to share information horizontally with the very HCPN partners they are contractually accountable to for coordinated patient care. This represents a fundamental misalignment between information architecture and the legal service delivery structure established by the UHC Act. </div>

------

## Argument 2: Sustainable Financing

**Established Facts from UHC Act:**

- Two distinct financing streams converge at P/CWHS level
  - Population-based services: DOH-funded through tax revenues to P/CWHS
  - Individual-based services: PhilHealth-funded through premiums to HCPNs
- Both pooled in Special Health Fund
- Governed by Provincial and City Health Boards
- NHDR mandated to support both DOH and PhilHealth data requirements

<div class="notes"> The second core argument addresses sustainable financing. The UHC Act establishes two distinct financing streams that converge at the P/CWHS level. Population-based services—health promotion, disease surveillance, environmental health—are funded by DOH through tax revenues and contracted to P/CWHS. Individual-based services—clinical consultations, diagnostics, treatment—are funded by PhilHealth through premium contributions and contracted to HCPNs. Both streams are pooled and managed through the Special Health Fund governed by Provincial and City Health Boards. The NHDR is mandated to support both DOH and PhilHealth data requirements. </div>

------

## Argument 2: Implementation Experience Pattern

**Observed from field implementation:**

- Systems delivering tangible operational value achieve higher adoption
- When clinicians access patient histories, nurses transmit results electronically
- Users become system advocates and champions
- Systems perceived as data extraction tools create burden without local benefit
- Generate user resistance and sustainability challenges

<div class="notes"> From implementation experience, we observe a consistent pattern. Health information systems that deliver tangible operational value at the point of use achieve higher adoption rates and sustainability than systems designed primarily for external reporting. When clinicians can access patient histories during consultations, when nurses can transmit laboratory results electronically, and when referral coordinators can track patient movement across facilities, these users become system advocates and champions. Conversely, systems perceived primarily as data extraction tools for external reporting create work burden without providing local benefit, generating user resistance and sustainability challenges. </div>

------

## Argument 2: Position on Value

**HIE infrastructure should be financed where it creates direct operational value**

- Value created first at local level through:
  - Improved clinical workflows
  - Reduced duplicate testing
  - Enhanced referral coordination
  - Better care continuity

<div class="notes"> Based on this pattern, my position is that health information exchange infrastructure should be financed where it creates direct operational value—and that value is created first at the local level through improved clinical workflows, reduced duplicate testing, enhanced referral coordination, and better care continuity. </div>

------

## Argument 2: The Business Case

**When HIE delivers tangible local value supporting P/CWHS mandates:**

- Business case for SHF investment becomes rational
- Provinces and cities can justify investment
- Directly improves ability to fulfill legal mandate
- Supports integrated service delivery and pooled resource management

<div class="notes"> When HIE infrastructure delivers tangible local value supporting P/CWHS operational mandates, the business case for SHF investment becomes rational. Provinces and cities can justify investing in HIE capability because it directly improves their ability to fulfill their legal mandate to deliver integrated services and manage pooled resources. </div>

------

## Argument 2: The Risk of Misalignment

**When NHDR structured primarily for national aggregation:**

- Risks becoming unfunded mandate
- Effort and cost burden falls on local facilities
- Benefits accrue primarily to national policymakers
- SHF investment difficult to justify without local value
- Long-term sustainability remains uncertain

<div class="notes"> Conversely, when the NHDR is structured primarily for national data aggregation without clear local operational benefit, it risks becoming an unfunded mandate where effort and cost burden falls on local facilities but benefits accrue primarily to national policymakers. Without demonstrable local value proposition, SHF investment in data infrastructure becomes difficult to justify to Provincial and City Health Boards, and long-term sustainability remains uncertain. </div>

------

## Argument 2: Financing Policy Position

**Primary financing model:**

- SHF investment in local HIE capability
- Serves P/CWHS operational needs
- National data aggregation emerges as derivative benefit
- Not the sole justification for investment

<div class="notes"> Therefore, my financing policy position is clear: SHF investment in local HIE capability that serves P/CWHS operational needs should be the primary financing model, with national data aggregation emerging as a derivative benefit rather than the sole justification for investment. This aligns financing with value creation and ensures sustainability. </div>

------

## Argument 3: Implementation Sequencing

**LHS ML Framework - Established Facts:**

- Local Health Systems Maturity Levels with progressive stages
- Recognizes integration as developmental process
- Requires methodical progression through stages

<div class="notes"> The third core argument addresses implementation sequencing. The UHC Act and its implementing rules establish the Local Health Systems Maturity Levels framework with progressive stages. This framework explicitly recognizes that health system integration is a developmental process requiring methodical progression. </div>

------

## Argument 3: Stage 1 - Preparatory

**Information Track Requirements:**

- Focus on readiness, baseline assessment, and planning
- Conduct baseline assessment and gaps analysis
- Identify investment needs for health information management and ICT systems

<div class="notes"> Let me walk through the three stages. Stage 1, the Preparatory stage, focuses on readiness. The Information Track requires conducting baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for health information management and ICT systems. This is about understanding current status and planning the path forward. </div>

------

## Argument 3: Stage 2 - Organizational

**Information Track Requirements:**

- Focus on system development and capacity building
- Establish health information management and ICT development plans
- Implement functional EMR systems capable of submitting reports to DOH and PhilHealth
- Planning for NHDR begins
- Establish national health data standards for interoperability

<div class="notes"> Stage 2, the Organizational stage, focuses on system development and capacity building. The Information Track requires establishing health information management and ICT development plans and implementing functional EMR systems capable of submitting reports to DOH and PhilHealth. Critically, this is when planning for the NHDR begins, focusing on establishing national health data standards for interoperability. Notice the sequence—local systems first, then planning for national integration. </div>

------

## Argument 3: Stage 3 - Operational

**Information Track Requirements:**

- Focus on full operationalization
- Validated EMR systems linking PCPNs to secondary and tertiary providers
- Compliance with national health data standards for interoperability
- NHDR operational as single point of submission

<div class="notes"> Stage 3, the Operational stage, focuses on full operationalization. The Information Track requires validated EMR systems that link PCPNs to secondary and tertiary care providers, compliance with national health data standards for interoperability, and the NHDR operational as the single point of submission. This is the mature state—but notice it comes after local systems are functional. </div>

------

## Argument 3: Position on Sequencing

**NHDR strategy should align with maturity progression:**

- Stage 1 alignment: National efforts on standards, specifications, SCIV
- Stage 2 alignment: Priority on functional HIE within HCPNs and P/CWHS
- Stage 3 alignment: National aggregation when local systems functional

<div class="notes"> Based on this framework, my position on sequencing is that NHDR implementation strategy should explicitly align with this maturity progression rather than imposing uniform national submission requirements regardless of local system readiness. In Stage 1, national efforts should concentrate on establishing data standards, interoperability specifications, and certification processes—enabling local units to plan their systems with clear requirements. In Stage 2, the priority should be on establishing functional HIE capability within HCPNs and across P/CWHS boundaries where local systems prove value through improved care coordination. Only in Stage 3, when local systems are functional and delivering operational value, should national aggregation through federation become the focus—at which point it becomes both technically feasible and politically sustainable. </div>

------

## Argument 3: The Reversal Problem

**Implementing national submission before local exchange capability:**

- Reverses developmental logic of LHS ML framework
- Asks facilities to report upward before communicating horizontally
- Prioritizes national policy needs over clinical care coordination
- Contradicts UHC Act mandates for HCPN coordination

<div class="notes"> The problem being highlighted is this: implementing national data submission requirements before local exchange capability is functional reverses the developmental logic established by the LHS ML framework. It asks facilities to report upward before they can communicate horizontally with HCPN partners, prioritizing national policy needs over the clinical care coordination needs that the UHC Act mandates HCPNs to fulfill. This is backwards. </div>

------

## Argument 3: Success Measurement

**NHDR governance should measure:**

- Local HCPN functionality metrics first
- Before intensifying national aggregation requirements
- Align timeline with LHS ML progression

<div class="notes"> Therefore, the NHDR governance and implementation timeline should explicitly measure success based on local HCPN functionality metrics before intensifying national aggregation requirements. This aligns the NHDR implementation with the developmental reality that the UHC Act already recognizes. </div>

------

## Policy Position 1: NHDR as Network of Networks

**Establish NHDR architecture as federation of local HIEs:**

- Primary data exchange operates at P/CWHS level
- Enables HCPN members to share patient information and coordinate care
- National aggregation through federation of local exchanges
- P/CWHS systems submit consolidated data after serving local needs
- NHDR as integration hub for standardized data from autonomous but interoperable systems

<div class="notes"> Based on these three core arguments, here are four policy positions. First, the NHDR should be explicitly conceptualized and implemented as a network of networks rather than a single centralized repository with direct facility connections. This means primary data exchange architecture operates at the P/CWHS level, enabling HCPN members to share patient information, coordinate referrals, and support care delivery within their natural service delivery networks. National data aggregation occurs through federation of these local exchanges, with P/CWHS systems submitting consolidated data to the NHDR after serving local operational needs. The NHDR serves as the integration hub for standardized data from autonomous but interoperable local systems, not as the primary destination for individual facility submissions. </div>

------

## Policy Position 1: Alignment Principle

**This approach respects co-location of accountability and information capability:**

- P/CWHS have authority over health facilities
- P/CWHS have responsibility for health outcomes
- P/CWHS must have operational control over information systems
- Supports fulfillment of legal functions

<div class="notes"> This approach respects the principle that accountability and information capability must be co-located. Just as P/CWHS have authority over their health facilities and responsibility for health outcomes, they must have operational control over the information systems that support those functions. This is fundamental to enabling them to fulfill their legal mandate. </div>

------

## Policy Position 2: Reorient NHDR Governance

**Shift from national reporting to local service delivery enablement:**

- DOH and PhilHealth frameworks prioritize local HIE functionality
- Success metrics focus on clinical and operational outcomes
  - Referral completion rates
  - Medication reconciliation accuracy
  - Emergency information availability
- Not just data submission timeliness

<div class="notes"> Second, current NHDR governance emphasis on national data submission and reporting requirements must shift toward empowering and enabling service delivery capabilities at the local level. This requires DOH and PhilHealth governance frameworks that explicitly prioritize local HIE functionality over national reporting convenience. Success metrics should focus on clinical and operational outcomes—referral completion rates, medication reconciliation accuracy, emergency information availability—rather than just data submission timeliness. </div>

------

## Policy Position 2: Investment and Regulation

**Reorient priorities:**

- Investment priorities channel resources to P/CWHS HIE infrastructure
- Capacity building before national data center expansion
- Regulatory requirements mandate HCPN information exchange capability
- As core network function, not just data submission compliance

<div class="notes"> This also requires reorienting investment priorities to channel resources toward P/CWHS HIE infrastructure and capacity building before national data center expansion. Regulatory requirements should mandate HCPN information exchange capability as a core network function, not just data submission compliance. </div>

------

## Policy Position 2: Stop Treating NHDR as Reporting Tool

**The fundamental shift:**

- Health information exchange exists first to improve patient care
- National surveillance, research, policy planning are important but derivative
- These purposes must not drive architecture
- Cannot undermine local clinical value

<div class="notes"> The goal is to stop treating the NHDR as primarily a national reporting mechanism. Health information exchange exists first to improve patient care. National surveillance, research, and policy planning are important but derivative purposes that must not drive architecture in ways that undermine local clinical value. This is the fundamental shift in thinking being advocated. </div>

------

## Policy Position 3: Align Financing With Local Value

**PhilHealth and DOH financing policies must recognize:**

- Sustainable HIE requires investment where value is created
- Clear policy guidance for SHF investment in HIE infrastructure
- As core function supporting both DOH and PhilHealth contracting

<div class="notes"> Third, PhilHealth and DOH financing policies must recognize that sustainable health information exchange requires investment where value is created. This means clear policy guidance that P/CWHS may and should invest Special Health Fund resources in HIE infrastructure and operations as a core function supporting both DOH and PhilHealth contracting requirements. </div>

------

## Policy Position 3: Create Financial Incentives

**Policy mechanisms needed:**

- PhilHealth contracting recognizes HIE capability as quality indicator
- HIE as network readiness requirement
- Creates financial incentives for investment
- DOH technical assistance for P/CHBs to plan, finance, govern HIE using SHF

<div class="notes"> PhilHealth contracting and payment policies should explicitly recognize HIE capability as a quality indicator and network readiness requirement, creating financial incentives for investment. DOH should provide technical assistance and capacity building support focused on helping Provincial and City Health Boards plan, finance, and govern their HIE systems using SHF resources. </div>

------

## Policy Position 3: Eliminate Unfunded Mandates

**Critical financing reform:**

- Eliminate structures treating NHDR compliance as unfunded mandate
- Stop channeling resources only to national-level infrastructure
- Enable local investment supporting both revenue streams
- Built-in sustainability when local systems invest in operational value

<div class="notes"> Critically, there is a need to eliminate financing structures that treat NHDR compliance as an unfunded mandate while channeling resources to national-level infrastructure. When local health systems can invest SHF resources in HIE capability that delivers tangible operational value and supports both revenue streams—DOH population-based contracts and PhilHealth individual service payments—sustainability becomes built-in rather than perpetually problematic. </div>

------

## Policy Position 4: Cease Bypass Architectures

**DOH and PhilHealth must immediately cease:**

- Planning NHDR where facilities report directly to national repository
- While unable to exchange data with HCPN partners
- This architecture fundamentally misaligns with UHC implementation

<div class="notes"> Fourth and finally, DOH and PhilHealth must immediately cease planning and investment in NHDR architectures where individual health facilities report directly to national repositories while remaining unable to exchange data with their HCPN partners. This architecture is fundamentally misaligned with UHC implementation. </div>

------

## Why Bypass Architecture Fails

**Fundamental misalignments:**

- Disconnects information flow from service delivery accountability
- Creates data extraction burden without local operational benefit
- Forces facilities to report upward before coordinating horizontally
- Undermines rather than enables integrated health systems UHC mandates

<div class="notes"> Why does this bypass architecture fail? Because it disconnects information flow from service delivery accountability relationships. It creates data extraction burden without local operational benefit. It forces facilities to report upward before they can coordinate horizontally. It undermines rather than enables the integrated health systems UHC mandates. Every one of these is a violation of sound health system design. </div>

------

## Redirect All Investment

**All NHDR investment and technical assistance should focus on:**

- Empowering P/CWHS to establish functional HIE within HCPNs
- Ensuring HCPN members exchange patient information in real-time
- Supporting referrals, consultations, care coordination
- Building local capacity for data governance, system operation, privacy protection

<div class="notes"> Instead, all NHDR investment and technical assistance should focus on empowering P/CWHS to establish functional HIE capability within their HCPNs; ensuring HCPN members can exchange patient information in real-time to support referrals, consultations, and care coordination; building local capacity for data governance, system operation, and privacy protection. </div>

------

## The Correct Roadmap

**Implementation sequence:**

- Establish clear pathways for P/CWHS systems to federate into national NHDR
- Only after local functionality is proven
- Operational roadmap prioritizes local exchange capability first
- National consolidation follows as secondary stage

<div class="notes"> There is a need to establish clear pathways for P/CWHS systems to federate into the national NHDR, but only after local functionality is proven. The operational roadmap must prioritize local exchange capability first, with national consolidation following as a secondary stage once the foundation is functional. </div>

------

## Conclusion: The Choice Before DOH and PhilHealth

**Path 1: Continue current trajectory**

- Centralized national data collection
- Treats facilities as data sources for national purposes
- Disconnected from service delivery accountability
- Starved of resources for local functionality

<div class="notes"> In conclusion, the choice before DOH and PhilHealth is clear. The first path is to continue down the current trajectory of centralized national data collection that treats facilities as data sources for national purposes, disconnected from their service delivery accountability and starved of resources for local functionality. </div>

------

## Conclusion: The Alternative Path

**Path 2: Network-of-networks approach**

- Empowers P/CWHS to build HIE serving HCPNs first
- Finances sustainably through Special Health Fund
- Governs through P/CHBs where accountability resides
- Federates local systems into national repository
- Built on foundation of local value and capability

<div class="notes"> Or the second path: embrace a network-of-networks approach that empowers P/CWHS to build HIE capability that serves their HCPNs first, finances it sustainably through the Special Health Fund, governs it through Provincial and City Health Boards where accountability resides, and federates these local systems into a truly national repository built on a foundation of local value and capability. </div>

------

## The Only Viable Path Forward

**Only the second path:**

- Aligns with UHC principles
- Will succeed in implementation
- Time to realign NHDR with UHC implementation reality

<div class="notes"> Only the second path aligns with UHC principles. Only the second path will succeed in implementation. It is time to realign NHDR implementation with UHC implementation reality. Thank you. </div>
