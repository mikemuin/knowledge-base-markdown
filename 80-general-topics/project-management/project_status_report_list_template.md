## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Period Highlights:

- Development environment delivered (milestone completed)
- Vendor contract negotiations are progressing well
- Change Management Plan approved

### Key Concerns:

- Resource constraint threatens timeline if not resolved by Feb 08
- Vendor API documentation delay may push Integration Testing by 3-5 days
- Dependency on the architecture decision creating cross-stream bottleneck

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate:** Approve temporary resource backfill for resource constraint (decision needed by Feb 05)
2. **This Week:** Finalize cloud platform decision to unblock work streams
3. **Next Period:** Conduct risk workshop (Feb 12) to reassess the critical path given current delays

**Next Report Date:** [Date]
