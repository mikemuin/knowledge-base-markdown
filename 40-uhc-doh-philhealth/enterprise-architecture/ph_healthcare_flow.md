# PH Healthcare Flow

It is a common misperception that each health center or facility needs to interact directly with the Department of Health (DOH) on a national level for implementation. In reality, the Philippine health system, particularly under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, operates through a multi-layered structure with various entities involved in reporting and funding.

Here's a breakdown of the layers involved in reporting up and funding down:

**I. Reporting Up: Data and Information Flow**

The reporting structure is designed to consolidate data from the ground level up to the national bodies, ensuring comprehensive oversight and evidence-based planning.

1. **Primary Care Facilities (PCFs) / Rural Health Units (RHUs) / Health Centers / Hospitals**:
   - These are the foundational units that **collect raw health and health-related data** through their operations.
   - They are mandated to maintain health information systems, including Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, capable of submitting reports.
   - For specific surveillance data like Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS), manual collection at the RHU level is common, with data then encoded for submission.
   - Hospitals also submit reports on aspects like nursing, pharmacy, and patient safety.
2. **Municipal/Component City Health Offices (MHO/CCHO)**:
   - These offices **initiate the formulation of local investment plans for health (LIPH)** and their Annual Operational Plans (AOPs).
   - They are responsible for the **efficient collection, validation, and consolidation of data** from facilities within their jurisdiction before submitting to higher levels.
3. **Provincial/City Health Offices (PHO/CHO)**:
   - The PHO/CHO is responsible for **health service delivery and health systems management** within their province or city.
   - They serve as the **technical secretariat to the Provincial/City Health Board (P/CHB)** and oversee technical integration.
   - They **consolidate municipal and component city plans** into province-wide or city-wide plans and lead the implementation of AOPs.
   - They also perform **validation of data** before further submission.
4. **Centers for Health Development (CHDs) / Ministry of Health - Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (MOH-BARMM)**:
   - As the DOH's regional arms, CHDs **oversee the integration of local health systems** and provide necessary technical support.
   - They **review LIPHs and AOPs**, recommend proposals for assistance, and provide overall data management and analysis for monitoring frameworks like the Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML) within their regions.
   - They are crucial in **validating and submitting official data** (e.g., LGU Health Scorecard data) to DOH Central Office bureaus.
   - DOH Representatives, who are members of the Local Health Boards, work at this level, linking the DOH to the LGUs and assisting with data-related mandates.
5. **DOH Central Office Bureaus and Services**:
   - Various bureaus, such as the Bureau of Local Health Systems Development (BLHSD), Epidemiology Bureau (EB), and Health Facilities Development Bureau (HFDB), receive and process data from the CHDs and LGUs for monitoring, policy development, and program planning.
   - The **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)**, when fully operational, is intended to be the **single point of submission and authoritative repository** for all health and health-related data, consolidating information from various sources including existing information systems like FHSIS. This aims for a national interoperable digital health ecosystem.

**II. Funding Down: Resource Allocation and Management**

Funding flows primarily from the national government to LGUs, with oversight and specific mechanisms to ensure utilization for health services.

1. **National Government (DOH, PhilHealth, DBM, DOF, DILG)**:
   - The **national government finances population-based health services** through the DOH, provided free at the point of service.
   - It also **supports LGUs in financing capital investments** and population-based interventions.
   - The DOH provides financial grants and incentives to LGUs for health system integration.
   - **PhilHealth primarily finances individual-based health services** through prepayment mechanisms. PhilHealth also moves towards performance-driven, closed-end payment mechanisms like capitation and global budgets for primary care.
   - Specific funds are allocated by DOH, PhilHealth, and other agencies for the development and upgrading of health information systems and other UHC-related initiatives.
2. **Local Government Units (LGUs - Provinces, Highly Urbanized Cities, Independent Component Cities)**:
   - LGUs are mandated to **appropriate counterpart funding** for health programs based on their Local Investment Plans for Health (LIPHs).
   - The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is a critical mechanism created at the provincial/city level** for contracting province-wide and city-wide health systems.
   - The SHF is exclusively utilized for health programs, projects, and activities, including services, capital investments, operating costs, and remuneration for health workers.
   - LGUs are expected to ensure resources for the National Health Human Resource Master Plan and implement incremental creation of HRH positions.
3. **Provincial/City Health Boards (P/CHBs)**:
   - The P/CHB is the **steward of the integrated local health system** and assumes full responsibility for the management of the SHF.
   - They **approve the LIPH and AOPs**, which serve as the basis for contractual agreements with DOH and PhilHealth and for the allocation of LGU counterpart funds.
4. **Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs) / Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs)**:
   - HCPNs, especially PCPNs as their foundation, are contracted by PhilHealth for the delivery of individual-based health services, particularly through the Konsulta Package, which is transitioning into a Comprehensive Outpatient Benefit Package (COBP).
   - These networks are expected to adhere to performance-driven payment mechanisms.

In summary, the interaction in the Philippine health system is a **multi-tiered process**, with health centers and facilities reporting to their respective municipal/city and provincial health offices, which then coordinate with DOH's regional centers (CHDs). These regional centers serve as crucial intermediaries, linking local efforts to national policies and vice versa. Funding similarly flows from national agencies (DOH, PhilHealth) to the LGUs, often through designated mechanisms like the Special Health Fund, which are then managed at the provincial/city level and disseminated to local health facilities. This layered approach aims to manage the devolution of health services, ensure accountability, and integrate fragmented systems towards Universal Health Care.
