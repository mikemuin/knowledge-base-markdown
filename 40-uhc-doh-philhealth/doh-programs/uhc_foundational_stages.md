# UHC Foundational Stages

There are **three foundational stages** that lead to the final realization of Universal Health Care (UHC) in the Philippines, followed by the **ultimate goal of UHC**. These stages outline what needs to be done or achieved before progressing, primarily drawing from the framework for Local Health Systems (LHS) integration which serves as a backbone for service delivery under the UHC Act.

------

### Stage 1: Preparatory Level (LHS ML Level I)

This initial stage focuses on **readiness, formal commitments, and baseline assessments** essential for initiating health system reforms and integration.

- **LGU Commitment to Integration**: Provinces, Highly Urbanized Cities (HUCs), and Independent Component Cities (ICCs) must formally **commit to integrating their local health systems** into Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). This requires securing legal and political support, often formalized through resolutions or Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs).

- Baseline Assessment and Situational Analysis

: A thorough evaluation of the existing local health system is critical. This includes:

  - **Inventory and mapping of public and private health facilities**, assessing their service availability and readiness.
  - **Assessment of capacities and training needs of Human Resources for Health (HRH)**.
  - **Population profiling and risk stratification**.
  - Evaluating the **presence and functionality of management support systems**, such as referral systems, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health (DRRM-H) systems, epidemiologic surveillance systems (like FHSIS data points), health information systems, and health promotion programs.

- **Strategic Planning (Local Investment Plan for Health - LIPH / Annual Operational Plans - AOPs)**: Based on the baseline assessment, LGUs must **formulate a Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**, serving as a medium-term public investment plan, and its corresponding **Annual Operational Plans (AOPs)**. These plans specify strategic directions, interventions, and investment needs, including for primary care services which are central to the Konsulta Package.

- **Organizational Structure Development**: Strengthening policy and technical management structures, such as the Provincial/City Health Board (P/CHB) and establishing technical divisions within the Provincial/City Health Office (P/CHO), is fundamental.

- **Special Health Fund (SHF) Creation**: The **Special Health Fund (SHF) must be created**, along with a P/CHB resolution for its establishment and opening of a bank account in an authorized depository bank. This fund consolidates financial resources exclusively for health services and health system development.

### Stage 2: Organizational Level (LHS ML Level II)

This stage focuses on establishing **network-wide guidelines, resources, and management structures** to effectively facilitate and sustain the integration of local health systems.

- **Health Care Provider Network (HCPN) Establishment**: **HCPNs**, with **Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs) as their foundation**, are organized to deliver a continuum of care. PhilHealth prepares for and pilots the contracting of these HCPNs.

- Primary Care Policy Framework Implementation

: The health sector shifts towards a strong

primary care-oriented system

. This encompasses:

  - **Progressive expansion of the Konsulta Package**, integrating existing Millennium Development Goals (MDG) benefits and services previously funded by the Department of Health (DOH), and beginning its evolution into a comprehensive outpatient benefit package (COBP). This includes efforts like Konsulta+ and Konsulta with SDG-Related Benefits.
  - **Registration of every Filipino to a primary care provider of choice**.
  - **Delineation of financing mechanisms** where DOH contracts P/CWHS for population-based services, and PhilHealth contracts HCPNs for individual-based services.
  - Development of **guidelines and standards for primary care facilities and services**.
  - **Reorientation of health professional education curricula towards primary health care**.

- **Health Promotion Program Adoption**: P/CWHS adopt proactive and effective **health promotion programs and campaigns** in accordance with the Health Promotion Framework Strategy (HPFS). This also includes formally recognizing Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) as on-the-ground health promotion officers.

- **Health Information System Development**: A comprehensive **health information management/ICT development plan** is established for the entire P/CWHS. This includes the initial implementation of the Integrated Health Information System (iHISIM), particularly Stage 1 clinical modules (e.g., electronic health/medical records (EMR), referral system management, telemedicine). Planning for the **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)** begins, focusing on establishing national health data standards for interoperability.

- **Procurement and Supply Chain Management Plan**: A detailed procurement plan for the entire P/CWHS is developed.

- **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health (DRRM-H) Program Adoption**: The DRRM-H program is formally adopted through a P/CHB Resolution.

- **HRH Management and Development Plan**: Based on the baseline assessment, a detailed plan for HRH management and development, including distribution, staffing patterns, and training needs, is in place.

------

### Stage 3: Functional Level (LHS ML Level III)

This stage is characterized by the **operationalization and consistent delivery** of integrated health services and functional management support systems. It emphasizes monitoring for functionality and impact.

- Integrated Service Delivery

: The P/CWHS is actively delivering a

continuum of care

, with primary care serving as the foundation and point of initial contact. This includes:

  - **Validated electronic medical record (EMR) systems that effectively link PCPNs to secondary and tertiary care providers** within the P/CWHS, indicating progress in digital transformation.
  - Fully functional and coordinated **patient navigation and referral systems** within the HCPN.
  - The **Konsulta Package has fully transitioned into the Comprehensive Outpatient Benefit Package (COBP)** and is actively provided by contracted HCPNs, ensuring equitable access without financial hardship. This also includes the operationalization of PhilHealth GAMOT (Guaranteed Accessible Medications for Outpatient Treatment) for essential medicines.

- **Financial Integration and Sustainability**: The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is exclusively utilized for health services and health system development**. PhilHealth fully shifts to performance-driven, closed-end, prospective payment mechanisms (e.g., capitation, global budget) for individual-based health services, moving away from traditional fee-for-service models. Resources for HRH and health systems strengthening are rationalized and secured through the LIPH, AOPs, and the National Human Resources for Health Master Plan (NHRHMP).

- **Functional Health Information Systems**: The Integrated Health Information System Implementation Model (iHISIM) progresses to Stage 2 (non-clinical modules) and Stage 3, where the **iHIS integrates with the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE)**. The **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)** is operational as the single point of submission and authoritative repository of health data, with all health-related entities complying with national health data standards for interoperability. FHSIS data is intended to feed into the NHDR [Compendium Vol 1, p. 74, refers to FHSIS as data source for LIPH, in context, but NHDR Framework explicitly mentions central repository for various data sources like FHSIS for broader analysis].

- **Robust HRH Workforce**: There is increased availability of adequately and equitably distributed health workers across facilities and communities. Only individuals certified by the DOH and the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) are eligible to be primary care providers.

- **Evidence-informed Policy and Monitoring**: Regular monitoring and evaluation of UHC implementation are performed using tools like the **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** and **LGU Health Scorecard**, ensuring evidence-informed policy and continuous improvement. **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** is institutionalized as a fair and transparent priority setting mechanism, recommending funding and coverage decisions. Functional epidemiologic surveillance systems are in place. This stage signifies that a significant percentage of UHC Integration Sites have achieved at least 70% of their Level 2 Key Result Areas (KRAs), with some progressing to Level 3.

### Final Stage: Universal Health Care Realization

The ultimate vision, as mandated by the UHC Act, is to achieve a **comprehensive, integrated, and people-centered health system** where:

- **All Filipinos are guaranteed equitable access to quality and affordable health care goods and services and are protected against financial risk**.
- **Better health outcomes are universally achieved**, signifying an improved overall health status of the population.
- The health system is **responsive to the needs of the people**, consistently demonstrating efficiency, equity, and high quality of care.
- All local health systems are **fully integrated** as Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS), ideally mandated by an Executive Order following a positive independent evaluation.
- A **national interoperable digital health ecosystem** is fully operational, with the **NHDR serving as the single source of truth** for all health and health-related data.
- Health promotion and disease prevention are deeply embedded, fostering a **health-literate population** that consistently makes healthy choices within **health-enabling environments** and under **health-supportive governance**. The **8-Point Action Agenda** provides the strategic framework and specific interventions to guide the DOH and all stakeholders towards these ultimate goals.
