## Key Differences Between 2005 and 2009 Models

### Enhanced Focus Areas in 2009:

- **Closed Loop Medication Administration**: Stage 5 specifically emphasizes barcode medication administration
- **Advanced Clinical Decision Support**: More sophisticated CDS capabilities throughout higher stages
- **Interoperability Standards**: Greater emphasis on HL7 and IHE standards
- **Technology Requirements**: More specific technology infrastructure requirements
- **Patient Safety**: Enhanced focus on medication safety and clinical protocols

### Philippine Healthcare Context Considerations:

- **PhilHealth Integration**: Consider electronic claims processing requirements at each stage
- **DOH Regulations**: Ensure compliance with Philippine healthcare data privacy and security requirements
- **Local Workflows**: Adapt EMRAM stages to accommodate Filipino healthcare delivery patterns
- **Resource Constraints**: Plan staged implementation considering typical budget limitations in Philippine healthcare facilities
