# Healthcare IT Project Focus Framework

## Quick Reference Handout for Students & Professionals

## The Core Challenge

Healthcare IT projects fail when teams lose sight of the **"Why"** - leading to scope creep, complex success criteria, and diluted vision. This framework keeps projects focused on what matters most.

## The Foundation: 3 Essential Questions

### Question 1: What are the problems that need to be solved?

**Focus Tools:**

- What's the ONE core problem we're solving?
- What happens if we do nothing?
- Which problems are "must solve" vs "nice to solve"?
- What are we NOT trying to fix?

### Question 2: What are the success criteria for the project?

**Measurement Tools:**

- What's the simplest way to measure if we solved it?
- How will we know we're on track during implementation?
- What would constitute failure?
- How do we measure progress without waiting for full implementation?

### Question 3: What does success look like?

**Vision Tools:**

- Can we describe success in one sentence?
- Who benefits most from success, and how?
- What does "done" actually mean?
- What does 'better than today' look like?

## Managing Transition States

Healthcare IT rarely allows "big bang" implementations. Each transition state must:

**Solve a meaningful portion of the core problem**
**Advance measurable progress** toward success criteria
**Maintain operational stability** (critical in healthcare)
**Build foundation** for the next phase

**Key Questions:**

- What's the minimum viable improvement at each stage?
- If we had to stop here, would we have solved something meaningful?
- Does this phase move us closer to solving the core problem?

## Multi-Domain Perspective Check

For each of the 3 core questions, ask from these perspectives:

| Domain                  | Focus Area                | Key Question                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 💰 **Financial**         | Cost, ROI, efficiency     | What's the financial impact/benefit?      |
| 🏥 **Patients**          | External service delivery | How does this improve patient experience? |
| 👥 **Staff**             | Internal efficiency       | How does this help staff work better?     |
| 👨‍⚕️ **Doctors**          | Clinical effectiveness    | How does this improve clinical care?      |
| ⚙️ **Internal Process**  | Workflows, operations     | What processes are we improving?          |
| 📚 **Learning & Growth** | Capabilities, training    | What new capabilities do we gain?         |

## Weekly Focus Checks

**Red Flags - Stop and Realign:**

- Team members give different answers to "What problem are we solving?"
- Success criteria have grown beyond 3-5 key measures
- Vision requires technical jargon to explain
- Current activities don't advance core success criteria

**Green Lights - Stay the Course:**

- Everyone can explain the project in 30 seconds
- All decisions filter through the core problem
- Transition states deliver meaningful value
- Stakeholders stay aligned on the "Why"

## Decision-Making Filter

**Before approving ANY change, ask:**

1. Does this serve the core problem? *(Primary filter)*
2. Does this advance our success criteria? *(Measurement filter)*
3. Does this align with our vision of success? *(Alignment filter)*
4. Does this transition state maintain focus while delivering value? *(Transition filter)*

If any answer is "no" or "unclear" → **Executive review required**

## The 30-Second Test

**Every team member should be able to explain:**

- The core problem we're solving
- How we'll know we succeeded
- What success looks like
- Where we are in the journey

*If they can't, your project focus needs immediate attention.*

## Quick Start Checklist

**Before any planning begins:**

- [ ] Answer the 3 core questions
- [ ] Run the multi-domain perspective check
- [ ] Establish the 30-second elevator pitch
- [ ] Map transition state boundaries
- [ ] Set up weekly focus check schedule

**Remember:** Technology is just the tool. The "Why" is what makes the difference between project success and expensive failure.
