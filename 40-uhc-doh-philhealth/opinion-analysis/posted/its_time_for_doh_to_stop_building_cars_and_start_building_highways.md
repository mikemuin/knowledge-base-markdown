# It’s Time for DOH to Stop Building Cars and Start Building Highways

Other sectors in the Philippines have already proven what foresight and infrastructure-first strategies can achieve.

When the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) decided to build the digital rails for real-time money transfers, it didn’t set out to create a banking app. It built the infrastructure that would allow innovation to flourish. The result? Fintech companies like GCash and Maya took off, financial inclusion deepened, and millions of previously unbanked Filipinos gained access to financial services.

The same story played out in the telecommunications industry. When government regulations prioritized the creation of a robust telco backbone and incentivized expansion into far-flung areas, the results were transformative. Connectivity reached the nation’s Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA), enabling communication, education, commerce—and yes, even telemedicine.

### The Department of Health, Unfortunately, Took a Different Path

While other sectors focused on building highways for innovation, the Department of Health (DOH) remained stuck in an outdated paradigm— **doling out fragmented, outdated systems as if they were donations.**

For years, the DOH has offered systems like **iClinicSys** and **iHOMIS** as “free software” to local governments and hospitals. These were never intended to be interoperable components of a seamless national health ecosystem. Their purpose was narrow and bureaucratic—data entry tools for mandated reports, not enablers of efficient care delivery or coordinated health management.

### The Numbers Don’t Lie

The adoption of these systems has been painfully slow. Some reports suggest usage rates of **only around 10%**. Many local government units (LGUs) have resorted to **hiring encoders** to re-enter data manually or to using Google Sheets to meet reporting requirements. Instead of empowering health workers, these systems have created more layers of inefficiency.

And worse, by giving away “free” systems, DOH has unintentionally **stifled innovation**. Instead of nurturing a diverse ecosystem of locally built, context-aware solutions, it reinforced the “dole-out” culture: *as long as it’s free, we’ll tolerate it—even if it’s bad.*

This isn’t just a technology failure. It’s a **strategy failure.**

### From Building Cars to Building Highways

It’s time for DOH to stop acting like carpenters handing out poorly made furniture. The Department should act like **strategic architects**—building **long-term, scalable blueprints** for a national health information ecosystem.

The DOH’s job is not to build every clinic’s software. It’s to build the **highways**—the digital infrastructure and governance frameworks that allow health systems to connect, communicate, and collaborate.

As one analogy goes: **DOH shouldn’t be building cars. It should be building roads.**

Set the traffic rules, make sure everyone drives on the same side, and then let the market—innovators, private developers, LGUs, and partners—build the vehicles.

### The Health IT Highways: Foundational Infrastructure for a Connected Nation

Let’s imagine what these highways could look like—not as theoretical constructs, but as real, interoperable platforms that empower patients, providers, and policymakers.

#### 1. The National ePrescription Highway

**Concept:**
A secure, standards-based platform that allows any licensed prescriber in the country to issue an electronic prescription that can be validated, transmitted, and dispensed by any accredited pharmacy nationwide.

**Use Case:**
A patient visits a doctor in a remote clinic in Davao. The doctor sends an ePrescription through a national system. The patient chooses to have the medicine filled at a nearby pharmacy or a chain pharmacy in a different city, and the prescription is instantly visible and verifiable.

**Benefits:**

- Prevents medication errors and fraud.
- Allows real-time monitoring of drug utilization and stock levels.
- Reduces paper waste and administrative overhead.
- Builds the foundation for **pharmacovigilance** and **rational drug use analytics**.

------

#### 2. The National Patient Referral Highway

**Concept:**
A digital network connecting primary care providers, rural health units (RHUs), hospitals, and specialty centers to enable seamless patient navigation and continuity of care.

**Use Case:**
A barangay health station identifies a patient with a heart condition and refers them to a provincial hospital using a unified referral ID. The receiving facility has instant access to the referral details, clinical notes, and prior lab results. After treatment, the hospital sends the discharge summary back to the originating facility for follow-up.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces referral leakage and patient loss to follow-up.
- Shortens waiting times and improves case prioritization.
- Enables outcome tracking across the **Health Care Provider Network (HCPN)**, as mandated under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law.
- Improves health system efficiency and patient satisfaction.

------

#### 3. The National Immunization Registry

**Concept:**
A centralized, secure registry of all vaccinations administered across the country, from newborn to adult, integrated across public and private providers.

**Use Case:**
When a family relocates from Leyte to Cavite, their child’s vaccination record remains accessible to the new RHU. In an outbreak, DOH can quickly identify which barangays have low coverage and deploy targeted interventions.

**Benefits:**

- Strengthens epidemic preparedness and outbreak response.
- Prevents duplicate or missed vaccinations.
- Provides real-time analytics for coverage and cold-chain logistics.
- Links with PhilHealth’s benefit packages for incentive-based immunization programs.

### The Blueprint for Change: From Tactical to Strategic Leadership

Building these highways requires a shift from tactical software distribution to strategic system design. Here’s how DOH can lead that shift.

------

#### 1. Be the National Planner, Not the Software Developer

DOH must take on the role of a **national architect**, setting the direction for a unified health information ecosystem. This involves defining a **national health information architecture**—a conceptual framework that outlines how health data is captured, exchanged, and governed across the health sector. By focusing on architecture rather than app development, DOH empowers LGUs, startups, and private partners to innovate within clear boundaries.

------

#### 2. Set the Rules of the Road

Every effective ecosystem depends on standards. DOH must define and enforce **data standards** and consistent **privacy and interoperability protocols** under the **Data Privacy Act (RA 10173)**. When everyone follows the same “traffic rules,” data can move safely, meaningfully, and securely across systems.

------

#### 3. Build the Core Infrastructure

Just as BSP built digital payment rails, DOH must invest in **core platforms**—such as national patient identifiers, facility registries, master data management, and secure health data exchange layers. These foundational components enable systems interoperability without dictating who builds the applications. When infrastructure is in place, innovation naturally follows.

------

#### 4. Open the System to Competition

Innovation thrives in diversity. By opening APIs, publishing standards, and fostering a **sandbox environment**, DOH can enable startups, universities, and technology companies to develop interoperable health applications—from telemedicine tools to AI-assisted diagnostics. Healthy competition drives quality, cost efficiency, and user-centered design.

------

#### 5. Own the Architecture, Not the Apps

The DOH’s success should be measured not by the number of users it has on a single platform, but by how well **all systems connect**. Just as road builders don’t dictate what cars people drive, DOH should focus on interoperability, governance, and long-term sustainability—not front-end software design. Owning the **architecture** ensures flexibility, vendor diversity, and resilience across the entire health ecosystem.

------

#### A Call for Strategic Foresight

This is not about criticizing the DOH. It’s about urging a **shift in mindset**—from building apps to building systems, from managing projects to planning ecosystems.

Suppose DOH can focus on constructing the healthcare highways that connect facilities, providers, and patients. In that case, every Filipino will benefit from **truly connected, coordinated care**—where data follows the patient and information empowers decision-making.

But that will only happen if we stop paving little side streets—and start **building the highways**.

---

Other sectors built infrastructure first — fintech and telco thrived because of it.

It’s time for the Department of Health (DOH) to do the same.

Stop giving out fragmented systems. Start building **health IT highways**.

DOH shouldn’t build cars — it should build roads.
