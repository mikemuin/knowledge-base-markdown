To build reports for **Konsulta-Specific Utilization and Availment**, the following field-level data elements are relevant, drawing from the information on Electronic Konsulta Availment Slips (eKAS), Electronic Prescription Slips (ePresS), and Filipino registration data:

**From Electronic Konsulta Availment Slips (eKAS) and Electronic Prescription Slips (ePresS):**

These slips serve as proof of service and medicine availment, and are generated by PhilHealth-accredited Konsulta providers for every patient encounter [i, pc. 687]. The information captured in these documents is critical for utilization and availment reporting. Based on the provided template for a "Service Availment Slip for K+SDG Package" (similar to eKAS), the following data elements are included [pc. 684, 685]:

- **Patient Name** [pc. 684]
- **PIN (Patient Identification Number)** [pc. 684]
- **Age** [pc. 684]
- **Sex** [pc. 684]
- **Contact No.** [pc. 684]
- Services Provided:
  - **Service / Diagnostics** (e.g., Consultation) [pc. 684]
  - **Performed () / Not Performed (X)** [pc. 684]
  - **Date Performed (mm/dd/yyyy)** [pc. 684]
  - **Performed by (initials of HCI/Technician)** [pc. 684]
- Medications Provided:
  - **Name of Medicine** [pc. 684]
  - **Medicine Strength / Form / Volume** [pc. 684]
  - **Route** [pc. 684]
  - **Quantity Dispensed** [pc. 684]
  - **Date Dispensed (mm/dd/yyyy)** [pc. 684]
- **Prescribing Physician's Name and Signature** [pc. 685]
- **Prescribing Physician's License No.** [pc. 685]
- **Dispensing Personnel's Name and Signature** [pc. 685]
- **Name of Dispensing Facility** [pc. 685]
- Beneficiary Feedback:
  - Confirmation of **receipt of essential services** (Yes/No) [pc. 685]
  - Confirmation of **receipt of mentioned medications** (Yes/No/Not Applicable) [pc. 685]
  - **Comments/Suggestions/Complaints** [pc. 685]
- **Signature over Printed Name of Beneficiary** [pc. 685]

These slips are crucial as they are required to be submitted to PhilHealth [pc. 687].

**From Filipino Registration Data to Primary Care Providers (PCPs):**

LGUs, with DOH and PhilHealth assistance, are responsible for registering constituents to PCPs and maintaining a master list of their catchment population. This data is used for planning, budgeting, and program design [pc. 155]. While explicit field-level data elements for this registration are not fully detailed, the context implies the following:

- **Number of Filipinos Registered to a PCP:** This is a key metric for monitoring population coverage [pc. 155].

- Primary Care Provider (PCP) Information:

LGUs must maintain a database of PCPs within their health systems [pc. 158]. This would likely include:

  - **PCP Name** [pc. 158]
  - **PCP Location (e.g., Province, City/Municipality)** [pc. 158]
  - **Type of PCP** (e.g., public or private) [pc. 157, 158]
  - **Licensing/Certification Status** [pc. 157]
  - **Accreditation/Contracting Status** (with PhilHealth) [pc. 157, 158]
  - **Service Capability/Type** of the health facility [pc. 206]
  - **Availability of PhilHealth-Certified Information System** for Konsulta (Yes/No) [pc. 683]

- **Demographic Data of Registered Filipinos:** While not explicitly detailed for the *registration* process itself, other health data collection systems, like the Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS), collect demographic data such as **age, sex, and geographic location (region, province, city/municipality, district, barangay, zipcode)** [pc. 378, 379, 607]. Since Konsulta aims to integrate with broader health information systems, it is logical that this demographic information would be associated with registered beneficiaries.

- **Geographical Location of Registered Individuals** (within the LGU's territorial jurisdiction) [pc. 157].

- **Number of registered Filipinos for each PCP** based on facility standards and capability [pc. 156].

**General Data Requirements for Health Information Systems (relevant to Konsulta):**

The Universal Health Care Act mandates the submission of various health and health-related data to PhilHealth (which is shared with DOH) for evidence-informed policy and planning [i, pc. 707, 716]. This includes administrative, public health, medical, pharmaceutical, and health financing data [i, pc. 716]. The **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)** aims to be the single point of submission and authoritative repository for this data, intending to address issues of poor quality and untimely reporting [i, pc. 690, 771]. This broader context suggests that Konsulta data should contribute to these aggregated provincial and national reports.

Key data elements within the NHDR framework that would support comprehensive Konsulta reporting include [pc. 574, 575, 621, 622, 623, 624]:

- **Availed Health Services** (Population and Individual) [pc. 575]
- **Health / Medical Records** [pc. 575]
- **Health Human Resources** [pc. 575]
- **Health Promotions** [pc. 575]
- **Health Regulations** [pc. 575]
- **Health Services** [pc. 575]
- **Financial Data** (Budgets and Expenditures) [pc. 575]
- **Monitoring and Evaluation** data [pc. 576]
- **Program Activities and Projects** [pc. 576]
- **Performance Scorecards** (e.g., LGU Health Scorecard, Hospital Scorecard) [pc. 622]
- **Health Budget Utilization / Disbursement** [pc. 624]

Health information systems in general, including those used by PCPs for Konsulta, should automate and link clinical and non-clinical workflows, and be capable of generating and submitting health-related data and reports at both local and national levels [pc. 556].
