PhilHealth is mandated by the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act to incentivize the use of Health Information Systems (HIS), particularly Electronic Medical Records (EMR), primarily through contractual agreements and reforms to its payment mechanisms [1, 2].

The sources outline the following ways PhilHealth is intended to or recommended to incentivize the use of HIS/EMR:

### 1. Contractual and Policy Mandates for Incentivization

*   **Mandatory Inclusion in Contracts:** PhilHealth is required to **use its contracts to incentivize the incorporation of health information systems**, including the automation of clinical information, improvement of data quality, integration and use of telemedicine, and participation in regional or national health information networks [1, 2].
*   **Transition Incentives:** During the first three years from the enactment of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the UHC Act, PhilHealth and the Department of Health (DOH) are mandated to provide **reasonable financial and licensing incentives** to contracted health care facilities to encourage them to form Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs) [3-6].
*   **HIS Implementation as a Basis for Assistance:** The Integrated Health Information System Implementation Model (iHISIM), which guides EMR implementation, serves as one of the instruments for **determining the nature and level of assistance and incentives** to be provided by PhilHealth and DOH to implementing health care providers [7, 8].
*   **Incentive Scheme for Quality:** PhilHealth must establish an **incentive scheme** for health facilities to acknowledge and reward those that demonstrate better service quality, efficiency, and equity, using a rating system [9-12]. This rating system includes, among other measures, **compliance to guidelines and standards** prescribed by DOH and PhilHealth and the **submission of price information of health goods and services** [9, 11].

### 2. Linking Financial Mechanisms to EMR/HIS Use

PhilHealth is shifting its financing strategy toward mechanisms that encourage efficiency and data use, thereby implicitly incentivizing HIS adoption:

*   **Shift to Prospective Payment Mechanisms:** PhilHealth is endeavoring to shift to performance-driven, closed-end, prospective payment mechanisms, such as **capitation and global budgets**, for primary care and individual-based health services, moving away from the traditional fee-for-service models [13-22].
    *   The contracted HCPNs must have a **patient records management system, including electronic health records**, that ensures records are accessible by all providers within the network [23-27]. The ability to accurately report performance under these new payment models is fundamentally reliant on functional HIS/EMR [21, 28].
*   **Earmarking Reimbursements (Recommendation):** It is recommended that a **fixed portion of PhilHealth reimbursements of Local Government Units (LGUs) be earmarked for HIS infrastructure** [29].
*   **Linking Quality Metrics (Recommendation):** PhilHealth is recommended to **link provider quality metrics to EMR-based evidence** for value-based care [30]. This includes metrics focusing on prevention and managing chronic diseases (such as compliance with national practice guidelines, patient outcomes, and care coordination indicators) to align financing with clinical compliance and improved health outcomes [31].
*   **Payment Speed/Differentials (Recommendation):** Recommendations include explicitly linking **payment speed or differentials and disincentives to compliant, EMR-generated submissions** recorded at the point of care, and mandating the exclusive use of interoperable EMRs [32, 33].

### 3. Mandatory Compliance and Accreditation Requirements

EMR adoption is increasingly being integrated into the regulatory and accreditation processes managed by PhilHealth and DOH, functioning as a necessary requirement for participation in the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP):

*   **Accreditation and Licensing Requirement:** The implementation and maintenance of an integrated HIS (which includes EMR) is required to be part of the respective **licensing and accreditation requirements of DOH and PhilHealth** starting in October 2022 [34-37].
    *   One source explicitly states: **"No EMRs, no accreditation"** [38].
*   **Data Submission Standard:** Providers wishing to efficiently reimburse from PhilHealth are required to use **EMR/HIS that have certification conforming to the national health data standards for interoperability** [39].
*   **Tying Accreditation to HIS Roadmaps (Recommendation):** PhilHealth is recommended to **tie accreditation to costed HIS roadmaps**, requiring providers to detail comprehensive implementation costs (including EMR licensing, technical support, and training) to ensure sustainable funding [29].
*   **Discontinuing Interim Systems (Recommendation):** PhilHealth is recommended to establish a firm timeline to discontinue the interim **eKonsulta solution** and accelerate the alignment and accreditation of EMR providers capable of deploying validated systems to eliminate redundant data entry for healthcare providers [40]. PhilHealth's eKonsulta platform (now PhilHealth YAKAP) is currently one of the systems used for electronic claims submission for primary care packages [41-43].

### Challenges and Reported Gaps in Incentivization

Despite these stated policies and objectives, the actual implementation of incentives has faced significant challenges:

*   **Inconsistent Funding/Awareness:** PhilHealth funding for HIS implementation has been reported by workers from Health Care Institutions (HCIs) to be **inconsistent and delayed** [44]. Furthermore, stakeholders reported they **do not receive incentives**, and some PhilHealth members and HCPN personnel were **unaware of the incentivization mandates** [45, 46].
*   **Lack of Guidance on Capitation Use:** Respondents noted the **lack of clear guidelines on how to utilize PhilHealth capitations** for funding infrastructure and equipment [46]. In some areas, LGUs were unable to use these funds for hardware because they were required to return the funds to the general LGU funding pool [46].
*   **Denied Claims:** Denied claims and reimbursement concerns remain a persistent problem, sometimes due to the lack of interoperability and duplication in memberships, which results in the automatic denial of PhilHealth claims [44].
*   **Preference for Paper-based:** Some end-users still prefer paper-based records, seeing EMRs as a barrier due to the lack of computer literacy, manpower, hardware, and infrastructure [47]. Healthcare workers have also noted that the EMR sometimes feels like an added burden because it was designed for statisticians rather than reflecting the workflow of health providers [48-50].
