## Death by Committee: How Over-Governance Is Killing Digital Health Before It Starts

The National Health Data Repository (NHDR) has spent two years in gestation without producing a single working system. No live exchange, no pilot site, no data flowing anywhere. Yet meetings, steering groups, and technical working committees multiply every few months.

The problem isn’t lack of attention — it’s *too much of the wrong kind*. The NHDR has become a case study in **death by committee**, where governance expanded faster than implementation and bureaucracy replaced engineering.

What the Philippines needs isn’t another task force. It needs a small, technically competent team empowered to actually build something.

### When Governance Becomes Paralysis

Governance is supposed to guide action, not replace it. It exists to provide direction, accountability, and coordination. But when governance grows without execution, it turns into a self-reinforcing loop of discussion with no delivery.

In the NHDR’s case, the structure now looks like a maze:

- A national steering committee.
- Multiple technical working groups (TWGs) on standards, interoperability, and architecture.
- Separate groups for data privacy, registry design, EMR conformance, and FHIR readiness.
- Ad hoc panels for “expert review.”
- Inter-agency coordination meetings among DOH, PhilHealth, DICT, and NPC.

Each group produces minutes, resolutions, and draft frameworks. None produce functioning code.

The NHDR is being governed to death before it’s even born.

------

### How It Happened

The over-governance problem didn’t appear out of nowhere. It’s the result of three systemic habits in the public sector:

1. **Fear of accountability.**
Committees spread risk. The more people involved in decision-making, the harder it is to blame anyone for failure. The result is slow, cautious action that prioritizes consensus over progress.
2. **Process over product.**
Bureaucracy rewards compliance with process — number of meetings held, reports produced, documents approved — not outcomes. A “complete” governance structure is treated as success, even if nothing actually works.
3. **Consultation inflation.**
Every stakeholder is invited to every meeting “for inclusivity.” But inclusivity without focus leads to dilution. Specialists get drowned out by politics; technical decisions get stuck in semantic debates.

The result is a culture that confuses **discussion** with **development**.

------

### The Cost of Over-Governance

1. **Lost Time.**
Every week spent in meetings is a week not spent building or testing. Two years of NHDR meetings could have produced a functioning provincial data exchange by now.
2. **Wasted Expertise.**
Skilled technical people are forced to spend their time writing minutes instead of writing code. Engineers are turned into secretaries.
3. **Policy Drift.**
With too many actors, the message gets blurred. One group prioritizes FHIR, another pushes CSV, another wants blockchain. Without a single technical authority, direction changes every few months.
4. **Burnout and Apathy.**
Stakeholders eventually stop showing up. Attendance drops. Those who remain are the ones who have to be there, not the ones who can move the work forward.
5. **Loss of Credibility.**
Vendors, donors, and LGUs start tuning out. When every meeting feels like déjà vu, the NHDR stops being seen as a project and starts being seen as a perpetual talking point.

------

### Why Too Many “Experts” Is a Problem

Expert groups are supposed to bring clarity. Instead, the NHDR’s expert working groups became silos of opinion.
Each group tends to represent its institutional lens:

- Academics emphasize frameworks and theory.
- IT experts focus on standards and tools.
- Clinicians focus on workflow and privacy.
- Bureaucrats focus on policy alignment.

All valid, but without a unifying architecture and an empowered team to implement it, these perspectives cancel each other out.

What the NHDR got was not expertise — it was **expert fragmentation**. Every technical decision required clearance from multiple committees, leading to circular approvals that go nowhere.

The end result: no architecture, no prototype, no interoperability. Just an expanding cloud of concept papers.

------

### Governance Without Execution = Zero

There’s a simple rule in large digital projects:
**Governance without implementation capacity is a recipe for failure.**

Successful countries learned this early. Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia — all of which built OpenHIE-based health data exchanges — established clear structures:

- One small, empowered **implementation unit** under the Ministry of Health.
- Clear mandates and budgets.
- Technical leadership with authority to make architectural decisions.
- Committees for oversight, not micromanagement.

Their governance models didn’t depend on endless meetings. They depended on functional accountability.

The Philippines, by contrast, created governance before it created function.

------

### The Fix: Less Steering, More Driving

If the NHDR wants to get unstuck, it needs to flip the script. Here’s how:

#### 1. Establish a Dedicated NHDR Implementation Unit

- Staff it with integration engineers, data modelers, architects, and system analysts — not policy officers.
- Give it a small but stable budget line and authority to contract or develop directly.
- Make it responsible for **deliverables**, not documents.

#### 2. Redefine the Role of Committees

- Committees should **review** and **approve**, not **design** or **implement**.
- Limit participation to those directly accountable for decision-making.
- Require written feedback within fixed deadlines to prevent perpetual discussion loops.

#### 3. Collapse Redundant Groups

- Merge technical working groups into one **NHDR Technical Council** with sub-teams for data, interoperability, and infrastructure.
- Assign one clear chairperson per domain — someone empowered to make calls, not just mediate.

#### 4. Shift From Governance Metrics to Delivery Metrics

- Replace “number of meetings held” with “number of systems connected.”
- Replace “number of policies drafted” with “number of data flows live.”
- Governance should measure what moves, not what’s discussed.

#### 5. Build First, Refine Later

- Prototype in one province.
- Use existing EMRs, registries, and claims systems.
- Gather feedback, fix issues, and iterate.
Once something works, governance can standardize it. Governance should follow proof of concept — not precede it.

------

### What Leadership Should Look Like

Leadership in digital health is not about chairing meetings. It’s about **creating momentum**.
The NHDR doesn’t need another “champion” who gives speeches about digital transformation. It needs someone who understands both policy and code — who can sit with engineers in the morning and brief the Secretary in the afternoon.

Governance should empower that kind of leader, not bury them under approvals.

------

### What Happens If Nothing Changes

If the NHDR continues on its current trajectory, three things will happen:

1. **Donor fatigue.** Development partners will lose patience funding workshops with no results.
2. **Fragmentation deepens.** LGUs and private hospitals will build their own exchanges out of necessity.
3. **Regulatory capture.** Vendors will start defining de facto standards in the absence of a working national model.

By the time governance finally agrees on a plan, the rest of the ecosystem will have moved on without it.

------

### The Lesson From the Private Sector

When a hospital or IT company builds a new system, they don’t start with 10 committees. They start with a **product team** — a small group that delivers an MVP (minimum viable product) in months, not years. Then they scale.

The NHDR should operate the same way. Treat it like a startup inside government. Give it autonomy, protect it from bureaucracy, and judge it by results.

If DOH or PhilHealth can’t create that environment, digital health reform will remain stuck in endless committee loops.

------

### From Committees to Capability

The path forward is not less governance — it’s **smarter governance**.
The NHDR still needs oversight, accountability, and transparency. But those must coexist with actual capacity to build and deploy.

We don’t need 12 committees to agree that data should move. We need one team that can make it happen.

Two years of governance produced zero interoperability. One year of empowered implementation could deliver what’s been missing all along: *a working system*.

Let’s stop steering. Let’s start driving.
