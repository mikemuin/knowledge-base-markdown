# Building the Foundation: A Position on National Health Data Repository and Health Information Exchange

---

## The Position: Start Local, Build National

- Health Information Exchange must be built from the ground up
- P/CWHS-level implementation with national federation
- Not a top-down, centralized national repository approach
- This presentation establishes the foundational arguments for this position

<div class="notes">
Today I'm going to build the foundation for a critical position on how the Philippines should approach its National Health Data Repository and Health Information Exchange. The position is clear: Health Information Exchange must be built from the ground up, starting with provincial and city-wide health system-level implementation that eventually federates nationally. This is an argument against a top-down, centralized national repository approach. But to make this argument effectively, I need to establish three foundational concepts that will demonstrate why this position is not just preferable—it's the only approach aligned with the reality of how our health system actually works under the UHC Act.
</div>

---

## The Foundation of This Argument

- Three cornerstone concepts that support this position:
  - **Cornerstone 1:** Value is Local Before It's National
  - **Cornerstone 2:** Data Flows Follow Money Flows
  - **Cornerstone 3:** Governance Follows Accountability
- Each cornerstone builds the case for P/CWHS-level HIE

<div class="notes">
This argument rests on three cornerstone concepts. First, that value must be local before it's national. Second, that data flows must follow money flows. And third, that governance must follow accountability. These aren't just nice principles—each one directly supports the position that HIE must start at the provincial and city-wide health system level. By the end of this presentation, you'll see how these three cornerstones, taken together, make the case for this approach undeniable. Let me build this argument step by step.
</div>

---

## Foundation 1: Value is Local Before It's National

- **The Argument:** HIE must deliver tangible value at the point of care before attempting national aggregation
- **Why This Matters:** Without local value, no one will use the system
- This foundation establishes the "why start local" argument

<div class="notes">
The first foundation of this argument establishes that health information exchange must deliver tangible clinical and operational value at the point of care before attempting national-scale aggregation. This isn't just about making frontline workers happy—it's about whether the system gets adopted at all. Without local value, no one will use the system, and all our technical sophistication becomes irrelevant. This foundation establishes the "why start local" part of the argument. Let me examine the evidence.
</div>

---

## Evidence: How Patients Actually Move

- Patient care pathways are predominantly local:
  - Pregnant woman: RHU → district hospital → RHU
  - Diabetic patient: health center → city hospital
  - Emergency patient: medical history scattered across local facilities
- Most patients never leave their P/CWHS for an entire episode of care
- **Implication:** Real clinical value happens within P/CWHS, not nationally

<div class="notes">
Here's the evidence for the first foundation. Look at how patients actually move through the health system. The pregnant woman moving from prenatal care at the rural health unit to delivery at the district hospital and back to postpartum care—this is intra-provincial movement. The diabetic patient referred from the city health center to the city hospital for specialist care—this is intra-city movement. The emergency patient arriving unconscious whose medical history is scattered across three facilities—those facilities are almost always within the same provincial or city health system. The vast majority of patients receive their entire episode of care within a single province or city health system because that's how referral networks are structured under the UHC Act. The implication is clear: Real clinical value happens within provincial and city-wide health systems, not nationally.
</div>

---

## Counter-Argument Addressed: National Aggregation

- **Counter:** "But we need national data for policy and surveillance"
- **Response:** Yes, but that's a derivative benefit, not the primary driver
- National aggregation that burdens frontline workers without local benefit creates resentment
- Build local value first, national aggregation emerges naturally from functioning local systems

<div class="notes">
Now, let me anticipate the counter-argument: "But we need national data for policy and surveillance." The response is: Yes, absolutely—but that's a derivative benefit, not the primary driver of HIE implementation. National data aggregation is valuable for health policy, research, and surveillance. This isn't an argument against it. This is an argument about sequence. National aggregation that burdens frontline workers without providing local benefit creates resentment and resistance. It turns the HIE into what workers call a "data extraction tool"—something that creates work for them to serve distant policymakers. Build local value first, and national aggregation emerges naturally from well-functioning local systems. The data flows up because it's already being used effectively at the local level.
</div>

---

## Foundation 1 Supports This Position

- If clinical value is predominantly local (evidence shows it is)
- And if technology adoption requires users to see immediate personal value (it does)
- **Then:** HIE implementation must start at P/CWHS level where value is delivered
- **Not:** At national level where value is abstract and distant

<div class="notes">
Let me connect Foundation 1 to this position. If clinical value is predominantly local—and the evidence clearly shows it is—and if technology adoption requires users to see immediate personal value—which every study of health IT adoption confirms—then HIE implementation must start at the provincial and city-wide health system level where that value is actually delivered. Not at the national level where the value is abstract and distant from the frontline workers we're asking to change their workflows and adopt new systems. A doctor who can pull up a patient's complete medication history in the emergency room becomes a champion. That's local value. That's what drives adoption. That's why the argument is we must start local.
</div>

---

## Foundation 2: Data Flows Follow Money Flows

- **The Argument:** HIE architecture must align with actual financing mechanisms
- **Why This Matters:** Systems that don't align with money flows don't get sustained
- This foundation establishes the "how to sustain it" argument

<div class="notes">
The second foundation of this argument establishes that HIE architecture must align with actual financing mechanisms, not organizational charts or ideal structures. This isn't cynicism—it's realism. Systems that don't align with how money actually flows don't get sustained, period. If DOH central office funds an HIE but the benefits accrue to LGUs, it becomes an unfunded mandate. If PhilHealth requires connectivity but doesn't recognize it in payment mechanisms, facilities won't prioritize it. This foundation establishes the "how to sustain it" part of the argument. Let me examine how money actually flows in our health system.
</div>

---

## Evidence: UHC Act's Two Financing Streams

| Service Type     | Payer                 | Recipient      | Accountability                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Population-based | DOH (taxes)           | P/CWHS         | Disease surveillance, program coverage |
| Individual-based | PhilHealth (premiums) | HCPNs (P/CWHS) | Encounter records, claims validation   |

- Both streams converge at Special Health Fund (P/CWHS level)
- **Implication:** P/CWHS is the natural funding and accountability point

<div class="notes">
Here's the evidence for the second foundation. The Universal Health Care Act creates two distinct financing streams. Population-based services like health promotion and surveillance are DOH-funded through tax revenues. The law states that DOH shall endeavor to contract provincial and city-wide health systems for these services. Individual-based services like consultations and procedures are PhilHealth-funded through premiums and contracted to Health Care Provider Networks, which P/CWHS can constitute as public HCPNs. These are different payers, different recipients, different accountability mechanisms. But notice where both streams are designed to converge: at the Special Health Fund at the provincial and city-wide health system level. Both streams are intended to flow into and be managed through the SHF. The implication for HIE financing is clear: the provincial and city-wide health system is positioned as the natural funding and accountability point because that's where both revenue streams are designed to converge.
</div>

---

## HIE Must Serve Both Financing Streams

- **For DOH (population-based):** P/CWHS reports disease surveillance, program coverage, outcomes
- **For PhilHealth (individual-based):** Facilities document service delivery for claims and validation
- HIE funded from SHF serves both revenue streams that feed into it
- **Implication:** Sustainable financing is built-in at P/CWHS level

<div class="notes">
This financing reality creates clear requirements for HIE architecture. The HIE must serve both financing flows. For DOH's population-based services, the HIE enables provincial and city-wide health systems to aggregate and report data upward. For PhilHealth's individual-based services, the HIE enables facilities to document service delivery for claims validation. When the HIE is funded from the Special Health Fund and directly supports both revenue streams that feed into it, sustainable financing is built-in. The P/CWHS invests from their SHF because they directly benefit through improved service delivery to DOH and enhanced revenue capture from PhilHealth. This is self-sustaining. This is how you finance HIE in reality, not in theory.
</div>

---

## Counter-Argument Addressed: Central Funding

- **Counter:** "DOH or PhilHealth should centrally fund and operate the HIE"
- **Response:** That disconnects investment from benefit
- Central funding creates dependency and fragility
- P/CWHS won't maintain or enhance what they don't control and don't pay for
- SHF funding aligns investment with benefit and creates sustainability

<div class="notes">
The counter-argument here is: "Why can't DOH or PhilHealth just centrally fund and operate the HIE?" The response: Because that disconnects investment from benefit. When central agencies fund infrastructure that local entities must maintain and use, you create dependency and fragility. What happens when central funding is reduced or redirected? The local systems that depend on it fail. More fundamentally, provincial and city-wide health systems won't maintain or enhance systems they don't control and don't pay for. But when they invest from their Special Health Fund because the HIE directly supports both their DOH obligations and their PhilHealth revenue, they become owners, not users. They maintain it, enhance it, and sustain it because it's theirs and it serves their needs. That's the difference between fragile dependency and robust sustainability.
</div>

---

## Foundation 2 Supports This Position

- If both DOH and PhilHealth financing are designed to converge at SHF (UHC Act structures it this way)
- And if sustainable systems require investment to align with benefit (they do)
- **Then:** HIE should be funded and operated at P/CWHS level through SHF
- **Not:** Centrally funded by DOH or PhilHealth with local dependency

<div class="notes">
Let me connect Foundation 2 to this position. If both DOH and PhilHealth financing are designed to converge at the Special Health Fund—and the UHC Act explicitly structures it this way—and if sustainable systems require investment to align with benefit—which basic economics confirms—then HIE should be funded and operated at the provincial and city-wide health system level through the Special Health Fund. Not centrally funded by DOH or PhilHealth with local entities dependent on central resources. This position for P/CWHS-level HIE isn't just about where the clinical value is—it's about where the sustainable financing is designed to be. And that's at the P/CWHS level where both revenue streams are intended to converge.
</div>

## Foundation 3: Governance Follows Accountability

- **The Argument:** HIE governance should reside where health system accountability is designed to exist under law
- **Why This Matters:** Misaligned governance and accountability creates paralysis
- This foundation establishes the "who decides" argument

<div class="notes">
The third foundation of this argument establishes that HIE governance authority should reside where health system accountability is designed to exist under law. This is about decision-making power. When governance and accountability are aligned, decisions get made and problems get solved. When they're misaligned, everyone points fingers and no one has clear authority to act. Data sharing is fundamentally about trust, and trust requires accountability. You can't have governance authority without accountability, and you can't have accountability without consequences. This foundation establishes the "who decides" part of the argument. Let me examine where the UHC Act positions health system accountability.
</div>

---

## Evidence: UHC Act's Accountability Structure

- UHC Act establishes Provincial and City Health Boards as stewards of integrated health systems
- P/CHBs are positioned to have authority over:
  - Health facilities in their jurisdiction
  - Special Health Fund resource allocation
  - Health outcomes for their population
- P/CHBs are designed to make decisions on service delivery, quality, resource allocation
- **Implication:** Accountability is being positioned at P/CHB level

<div class="notes">
Here's the evidence for the third foundation. The Universal Health Care Act establishes Provincial and City Health Boards as the intended stewards of integrated health systems. The law states that P/CHBs shall oversee and coordinate the integration of health services, manage the Special Health Fund, and exercise administrative and technical supervision over health facilities and health human resources within their jurisdictions. Now, transparency is important here—the law uses "shall endeavor to integrate," which means full integration isn't yet mandatory. But the law is positioning P/CHBs as the governance bodies where accountability will reside once integration occurs. When health outcomes are poor, when quality standards aren't met, when resources are misallocated, the UHC Act is designed to hold Provincial and City Health Boards accountable, not DOH central office or individual facility chiefs. The implication is clear: accountability is being positioned at the Provincial and City Health Board level. That's the direction the law is heading.
</div>

---

## Current Status: Integration is Voluntary, Heading Toward Mandatory

- Currently: LGUs "shall endeavor to integrate" (not yet mandatory)
- National government provides support to LGUs that commit to integration
- Path to mandatory integration:
  - Independent study evaluates benefits
  - Positive recommendation from Secretary of Health
  - Presidential Executive Order makes it mandatory
- **Key Point:** The law establishes the framework and direction

<div class="notes">
Transparency is essential about where we are in implementation. Currently, the UHC Act uses the language "shall endeavor to integrate," which means P/CWHS integration is not yet mandatory—it's aspirational and voluntary. The law provides for national government technical and financial support to LGUs that commit to province-wide integration. The path to making it mandatory is clear: an independent study must evaluate the benefits, the Secretary of Health must give a positive recommendation, and then the President issues an Executive Order to make all local health systems integrate as prescribed by the law. So we're in a transition period. But here's the key point: the law establishes the framework and the direction. It positions P/CHBs as the governance bodies for integrated health systems. The argument is that we should build HIE architecture that aligns with where the law is heading, not where we were before the UHC Act.
</div>

---

## Governance Requirements for HIE

- P/CHBs should be positioned as HIE governance bodies for their jurisdictions
- They should decide:
  - What data is shared and with whom
  - Who can access what information
  - Which use cases get priority
  - How privacy and security are protected
- **Implication:** Build HIE governance to align with UHC Act's accountability framework

<div class="notes">
Given this accountability structure that the UHC Act is establishing, there are clear implications for HIE governance. Provincial and City Health Boards should be positioned as the HIE governance bodies for their jurisdictions. They should decide what data is shared and with whom, who can access what information, which use cases get priority, and how privacy and security are protected. Why? Because as integration progresses, they will be accountable for the outcomes. If there's a privacy breach, the P/CHB will be accountable. If critical clinical information isn't available when needed, the P/CHB will be accountable. If the HIE serves national reporting at the expense of local clinical care, the P/CHB will be accountable for the health outcomes that suffer. You cannot separate governance authority from accountability. The entity that will face the consequences should have the decision-making power. The argument is to build HIE governance now that aligns with the accountability framework the UHC Act is establishing.
</div>

---

## Counter-Argument Addressed: National Standards

- **Counter:** "But we need national standards and interoperability"
- **Response:** Yes, but standards aren't governance
- National standards for data exchange: absolutely necessary
- National governance over local data: disconnects authority from accountability
- Federal model: national standards, local governance

<div class="notes">
The counter-argument here is: "But we need national standards and interoperability—doesn't that require central governance?" The response distinguishes between standards and governance. Yes, we absolutely need national standards for data exchange, terminology, security, and interoperability. But standards aren't governance. Setting the rules for how systems communicate is different from deciding what data gets shared and who can access it. A federal model gives us both: national standards that enable interoperability, with local governance that places decision-making authority where accountability is being positioned. This is how successful federal health information exchanges work globally. National standards for the "how" of data exchange. Local governance for the "what" and "who" of data access. This position embraces both.
</div>

---

## Foundation 3 Supports This Position

- If UHC Act positions accountability at P/CHB level (it does)
- And if governance authority should reside where accountability exists (it should)
- **Then:** P/CHBs should govern HIE in their jurisdictions
- **Not:** Central DOH governance or distributed facility-level governance

<div class="notes">
Let me connect Foundation 3 to this position. If the UHC Act explicitly positions health system accountability at the Provincial and City Health Board level—and it does—and if governance authority should reside where accountability exists—which basic organizational theory demands—then Provincial and City Health Boards should govern HIE in their jurisdictions. Not central DOH governance that makes decisions without facing local accountability. Not distributed facility-level governance that fragments decision-making below the level where accountability is being positioned. This position for P/CWHS-level HIE with P/CHB governance isn't arbitrary—it's the structure that aligns governance with the legal accountability framework the UHC Act is establishing. We should build HIE architecture now that will work when full integration is achieved, not architecture that contradicts where the law is heading.
</div>

---

## The Complete Argument: Three Foundations Together

**Foundation 1 (Value):** Clinical value is local → Start implementation at P/CWHS level

**Foundation 2 (Financing):** Both revenue streams designed to converge at SHF → Fund through P/CWHS SHF

**Foundation 3 (Governance):** Accountability being positioned at P/CHB → Governance should align

**Together:** The coherent architecture is P/CWHS-level HIE with national federation

<div class="notes">
Now let me bring these three foundations together to complete the argument. Foundation 1 establishes that clinical value is predominantly local, therefore implementation must start at the provincial and city-wide health system level. Foundation 2 establishes that both DOH and PhilHealth revenue streams are designed to converge at the Special Health Fund, therefore HIE should be funded through the P/CWHS SHF for sustainability. Foundation 3 establishes that legal accountability is being positioned at the Provincial and City Health Board level, therefore governance should align with that accountability structure. When we take these three foundations together—value, financing, and governance—the coherent architecture is provincial and city-wide health system-level HIE with national federation. This architecture aligns with where the UHC Act is taking our health system, not where we were before.
</div>

## Testing Alternative Approaches Against These Foundations

- **Centralized National Repository Approach:**
  - Foundation 1: Fails—delivers national value before local value
  - Foundation 2: Fails—disconnects financing from local benefit
  - Foundation 3: Fails—places governance where accountability isn't positioned
- **Facility-Level Distributed Approach:**
  - Foundation 1: Weak—fragments value across facilities
  - Foundation 2: Fails—no connection to SHF financing
  - Foundation 3: Fails—places governance below accountability level

<div class="notes">
Let me test alternative approaches against these foundations. A centralized national repository approach fails all three foundations. It attempts to deliver national value before establishing local value, violating Foundation 1. It typically proposes central DOH or PhilHealth funding, disconnecting investment from local benefit and violating Foundation 2. And it places governance at the national level where health system accountability isn't being positioned under the UHC Act, violating Foundation 3. A facility-level distributed approach also fails. It fragments clinical value across individual facilities rather than delivering it at the health system level where care coordination happens, weakening Foundation 1. It has no connection to Special Health Fund financing mechanisms, failing Foundation 2. And it places governance below the level where the UHC Act is positioning accountability, failing Foundation 3. The P/CWHS-level approach is the only one that satisfies all three foundations.
</div>

---

## Why Sequence Matters in This Argument

- These foundations build on each other in sequence:
  1. **Value** establishes the "why" and "where to start"
  2. **Financing** establishes the "how to sustain"
  3. **Governance** establishes the "who decides"
- Breaking the sequence undermines the entire argument
- This position respects the complete sequence

<div class="notes">
The sequence of these foundations matters. These aren't three independent arguments—they build on each other. Foundation 1 on value establishes the "why" we need HIE and "where to start" implementation. Foundation 2 on financing establishes "how to sustain" the HIE over time. Foundation 3 on governance establishes "who decides" about data sharing and access. Each foundation assumes the previous one. You can't address financing without first establishing value—there's no reason to invest in something without value. You can't address governance without first establishing sustainable financing—there's nothing to govern if the system isn't sustained. Breaking this sequence undermines the entire argument. This position for P/CWHS-level HIE with national federation respects the complete sequence: start where value is delivered, fund it through the mechanism that captures both revenue streams, and govern it at the level where accountability is being positioned.
</div>

## The Reality of Implementation

- We're in a transition period under the UHC Act
- Some provinces and cities are already integrating voluntarily
- National government is providing support to early adopters
- **Critical Decision Point:** Build HIE architecture for where we're going, not where we've been
- Architecture built for the old fragmented system will be obsolete when integration is complete

<div class="notes">
Let me acknowledge the reality of where we are in implementation. We're in a transition period under the UHC Act. Integration isn't mandatory yet, but it's the direction we're heading. Some provinces and cities are already integrating voluntarily. The national government is providing technical and financial support to these early adopters. We're at a critical decision point for HIE architecture. Do we build for where we've been—a fragmented system of more than a thousand independent LGUs? Or do we build for where we're going—integrated provincial and city-wide health systems with clear governance and accountability? The argument is that we must build for where we're going. If we build HIE architecture for the old fragmented system, that architecture will be obsolete when integration is complete. We'll have to throw it away and start over. But if we build P/CWHS-level HIE architecture now, it will work during the transition and be perfectly positioned when full integration is achieved.
</div>

## Addressing the "Perfect Solution" Fallacy

- This position isn't perfect—it's aligned with UHC Act direction
- P/CWHS capacity varies → Address through implementation support, not architecture change
- National needs are real → Address through federation, not centralization
- Technical challenges exist → Address through standards, not governance structure
- **The Question:** Not "Is this perfect?" but "Does this align with where UHC Act is taking us?"

<div class="notes">
Let me address what could be called the "perfect solution" fallacy. Critics might say this position isn't perfect. That's correct—it isn't perfect. Some provinces and cities have stronger capacity than others. Some national use cases like pandemic surveillance need rapid data aggregation. Technical interoperability is genuinely complex. But here's the response: This position isn't about perfection—it's about alignment with where the UHC Act is taking us. Provincial and city-wide health system capacity varies? Address that through implementation support and capacity building, not by changing the architecture to avoid working with them. That's exactly what the UHC Act calls for—national government support to build P/CWHS capacity. National needs are real? Address those through federation that aggregates local systems, not through centralization that bypasses them. Technical challenges exist? Address those through national standards and technical assistance, not by relocating governance away from where accountability is being positioned. The question isn't "Is this perfect?" The question is "Does this align with where the UHC Act is taking our health system?" And the answer is yes.
</div>

## The Stakes: Why This Matters

- Getting architecture wrong means:
  - System that frontline workers resist
  - Unsustainable financing that creates dependency
  - Governance paralysis when decisions are needed
  - Architecture obsolete when UHC integration is complete
- Getting architecture right means:
  - Adoption driven by local value
  - Self-sustaining through aligned financing
  - Clear decision-making authority
  - Architecture that works now and scales when integration is complete

<div class="notes">
Let me be clear about the stakes. Getting the HIE architecture wrong means building a system that frontline workers resist because it doesn't serve them, operating on unsustainable financing that creates dependency on fickle central budgets, suffering governance paralysis when critical decisions about data sharing and privacy need to be made, and worst of all—building architecture that will be obsolete when UHC integration is complete. We've seen this pattern globally—technically sophisticated systems that fail because the architecture was wrong from the start. Getting the architecture right means building a system whose adoption is driven by clear local value, that's self-sustaining through aligned financing mechanisms, that has clear decision-making authority matched to where accountability is positioned, and critically—that works during the transition period and scales seamlessly when integration is complete. The difference between failure and success isn't primarily technical—it's architectural. It's whether we build for where the UHC Act is taking us or try to preserve structures that contradict that direction.
</div>

## Position Summary

**What:** P/CWHS-level HIE with national federation through standards and aggregation

**Why:** Because clinical value, financing, and accountability all converge or are positioned to converge at P/CWHS level under UHC Act

**How:** Funded through Special Health Fund, governed by P/CHBs, federated nationally through standards

**Evidence:** Three foundations demonstrate this aligns with UHC Act's direction

<div class="notes">
Let me summarize this complete position. What's being advocated is provincial and city-wide health system-level Health Information Exchange with national federation through standards and aggregation mechanisms. Why? Because these three foundations demonstrate that clinical value, sustainable financing, and legal accountability all converge or are being positioned to converge at the P/CWHS level under the UHC Act. How should we implement this? Funded through the Special Health Fund that is designed to capture both DOH and PhilHealth revenue streams, governed by Provincial and City Health Boards that are being positioned to hold accountability, and federated nationally through standards that enable interoperability and aggregation. The evidence supporting this position comes from three foundations that have been systematically built: value is local before it's national, data flows must follow money flows, and governance should follow where accountability is being positioned. Each foundation independently supports this position. Together, they demonstrate that this is the only architecture that aligns with where the UHC Act is taking our health system.
</div>

## Call to Action: Use These Foundations

When evaluating any NHDR/HIE proposal, demand answers to:

1. **Foundation 1:** Does it deliver immediate clinical value at P/CWHS level first?
2. **Foundation 2:** Does it align with SHF financing and serve both DOH and PhilHealth needs?
3. **Foundation 3:** Does it place governance where UHC Act is positioning accountability?

If any answer is "no" or "unclear" → Reject the proposal as misaligned with UHC Act direction

<div class="notes">
Here's the call to action. When you're evaluating any National Health Data Repository or Health Information Exchange proposal—whether from DOH, PhilHealth, development partners, or vendors—demand answers to three foundation questions. First, does it deliver immediate clinical value at the provincial and city-wide health system level first, before attempting national aggregation? Second, does it align with Special Health Fund financing and serve both DOH population-based and PhilHealth individual-based contracting needs? Third, does it place governance authority where the UHC Act is positioning accountability—with Provincial and City Health Boards? If any answer is "no" or "unclear," reject the proposal as misaligned with the direction of the UHC Act. Don't be swayed by technical sophistication, generous funding, or political pressure. A proposal that fails any of these three foundation tests will either fail in implementation or become obsolete when UHC integration is complete.
</div>

## Final Statement: Architecture Determines Destiny

- Technical details matter, but architecture matters more
- We can have the best technology, strongest security, most sophisticated standards
- But if the architecture doesn't align with where UHC Act is taking us...
- The system will fail or become obsolete
- **This position provides the only architecturally sound foundation for UHC's future**

<div class="notes">
Let me close with this final statement: In health information exchange, architecture determines destiny. Technical details matter—we need good technology, strong security, sophisticated standards. But architecture matters more. We can have the best technology money can buy, the strongest security protocols, the most sophisticated interoperability standards. But if the underlying architecture doesn't align with where the UHC Act is taking our health system—where clinical value is delivered, how the health system is being financed, and where accountability is being positioned—the system will either fail immediately or become obsolete when UHC integration is complete. This position for provincial and city-wide health system-level HIE with national federation provides the only architecturally sound foundation because it aligns with all three requirements and positions us for the future the UHC Act envisions. That's not opinion. That's the logical conclusion of the three foundations that have been systematically established today. Thank you.
