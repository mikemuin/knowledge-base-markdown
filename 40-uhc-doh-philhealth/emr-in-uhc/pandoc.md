# Universal Health Care (UHC) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

<div class="notes">
Welcome to this presentation on Universal Health Care and Electronic Medical Records. The UHC Law, Republic Act 11223, enacted in February 2019, establishes a framework to ensure that all Filipino citizens have equitable access to quality healthcare services. To support this ambitious goal, the UHC Law mandates the development of robust Health Information Systems, or HIS. The successful implementation of HIS is seen as the essential infrastructure of trust that allows UHC to function efficiently. Today, we will detail the specific requirements for Electronic Medical Records under UHC and discuss the real-world implications of their adoption or lack thereof.

- Key foundational standards:
  - Client Identifier: PhilHealth ID or PSA National ID
  - Messaging Standard: HL7 FHIR
  - Clinical Terminology: SNOMED-CT
- Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV) required
- All systems must pass validation for compliance

<div class="notes">
To ensure true interoperability, the Mandatory Adoption and Use of National Health Data Standards for Interoperability, outlined in JAO 2021-0002, is required. Key foundational registries and standards mandated for data exchange include the use of PhilHealth ID number or the PSA's National ID for unique patient identification. The messaging standard is Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or HL7 FHIR, which is an international standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. For clinical terminology, SNOMED-CT, or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms, is required for standardized medical documentation. Compliance with these standards is monitored through the Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation framework.

## Addressing the Data Burden

- Current EMR implementations create significant data entry burden
- Reduces healthcare workers' capacity for direct care delivery
- System should be built into end-user requirements
- Goal: Maximize care delivery effectiveness
- Minimize data entry time and effort
- Doctors' data inputs feed National Health Data Repository
- Critical role in providing timely, accurate information

<div class="notes">
Doctors must recognize that current EMR implementations often result in a significant data entry burden that reduces their capacity for direct care delivery. They should note that the system should eventually be built into the end-user requirements for health providers and clinicians, maximizing care delivery effectiveness while minimizing data entry. The National Health Data Repository serves as the single source of truth for all health data, making doctors' role critical in providing timely and accurate information for policy and planning. Addressing this data burden is essential to ensure that healthcare workers can focus on patient care while still contributing valuable data to the system.
</div>

## Call to Action for Doctors (Part 1)

- Champion digital adoption and transformation
- Implement EMR systems that have passed validation
- Use EMR real-time during patient encounters
- No batch encoding after patient visits
- Ensure data integrity at point of care
- Use compliant, EMR-generated submissions exclusively
- Review data in EMRs to maintain accuracy

<div class="notes">
The call to action for doctors involves embracing digital transformation and ensuring rigorous data integrity. Doctors and clinicians should actively implement and utilize EMR systems that have passed validation and are SCIV compliant. They should ensure that the EMR is used real-time during patient encounters, not just for batch encoding later, which is currently a common practice hindering efficiency. Doctors must ensure data integrity by utilizing compliant, EMR-generated submissions recorded at the point of care, and require exclusive use of interoperable EMRs with no parallel non-interoperable systems. Clinicians and doctors should review the data in the EMRs to maintain accuracy and quality.
</div>

---

## Call to Action for Doctors (Part 2)

- Drive system improvement by articulating functional specifications
- Advocate for systems with minimal data entry burden
- Support incorporation of Integrated Care Pathways
- Work with facility management to ensure EMR linkages
- Use EMR for patient navigation and two-way referrals
- Advocate for permanent plantilla positions for digital health teams

<div class="notes">
Doctors must drive system improvement by articulating the functional specifications required for simple census tools and EMR solutions that minimize data entry burden. They should advocate for systems that incorporate Integrated Care Pathways into the workflow. Doctors should work with facility management to ensure their EMR links their Primary Care Provider Network to secondary and tertiary care providers within the Health Care Provider Network. This involves using the EMR for patient navigation and two-way referrals. Finally, doctors should push for the creation of permanent plantilla positions for digital health teams in hospitals and Rural Health Units to oversee EMR implementation and provide daily support such as configuration, data stewardship, user help, and connectivity management.

## Reality: Challenges in Implementation

- Interoperability remains key challenge across integration sites
- Referrals and patient history still paper-based
- Proliferation of multiple systems:
  - iClinicSys
  - iHOMIS
  - Google Forms
  - Private EMRs
- Healthcare workers use multiple systems simultaneously
- Double or triple encoding of same information required

<div class="notes">
Despite the mandate, the reality of implementation faces significant challenges. Interoperability remains a key challenge across all selected integration sites. For instance, referrals and patient history are often still paper-based between health centers and hospitals. There is a proliferation of multiple systems such as iClinicSys, iHOMIS, Google Forms, and private EMRs implemented concurrently, which suggests the need for a standardized system. Healthcare workers routinely face the burden of using multiple systems, often requiring double or even triple encoding of the same information. This is due partly to the lack of interoperable systems and creates significant inefficiency in the healthcare delivery process.
</div>

---

## Continued Reliance on Paper Systems

- Many facilities continue using paper-based systems
- Causes:
  - Financial constraints
  - Inadequate equipment
  - Poor internet connectivity
- Common workaround: "Back encoding"
- Data collected on paper first
- Transferred to digital systems later
- Undermines real-time data availability

<div class="notes">
Many facilities continue to use paper-based systems due to financial constraints leading to inadequate equipment and poor internet connectivity. A standard workaround observed is what's called back encoding, where staff collect data on paper first, then transfer it later to digital systems. This practice undermines the availability of real-time data and defeats the purpose of having an electronic medical record system. It also creates additional work for healthcare staff who must essentially document patient encounters twice, once on paper and again in the digital system.
</div>

## Workforce and Financial Hurdles

- Lack of human resources for HIS is pressing issue
- Most ICT personnel hired under contractual arrangements
- Results in high turnover and difficulty sustaining systems
- Staff perform high-level ICT tasks beyond their skills
- Financial constraints result in inadequate IT infrastructure
- PhilHealth incentives for HIS not received by stakeholders
- Some stakeholders unaware of incentivization

<div class="notes">
The lack of human resources for health, particularly in HIS, is a pressing issue across all sites. Most ICT personnel are hired under contractual or job order arrangements, resulting in high turnover and difficulty sustaining systems. Staff often have to perform high-level ICT tasks beyond their skills and pay grade. Financial constraints result in inadequate IT infrastructure. Although PhilHealth is mandated to incentivize HIS, stakeholders reported they do not receive the said incentives, and some are even unaware that such incentivization exists. These workforce and financial hurdles create significant barriers to successful EMR implementation and sustainability.
</div>

## Impact on Patients and Claims

- Lack of interoperability affects patient care
- Data duplication issues with PhilHealth ID numbers
- Inconsistent patient identification across systems
- Persistent problem of claim rejections
- Reimbursement concerns for patients and providers
- Delays in receiving healthcare funding
- Financial strain on healthcare organizations

<div class="notes">
The impact of these challenges extends directly to patients. The lack of interoperability and data duplication, such as inconsistent PhilHealth ID numbers, leads to a persistent problem of claim rejections and reimbursement concerns. This directly affects patients' ability to acquire healthcare funding and places financial strain on healthcare organizations. When claims are rejected or delayed, patients may face unexpected out-of-pocket expenses, and healthcare facilities may struggle with cash flow issues. These problems undermine the core UHC goal of ensuring equitable access to affordable, quality healthcare services for all Filipinos.
</div>

## Consequences of Non-Standard Systems

- Current PhilHealth e-claims systems use APIs
- Not compliant with standardized FHIR messaging
- Risk: Proliferation of multiple non-standard API endpoints
- Each system integration requires custom development
- Significantly increases development costs and complexity
- Reduces system reliability and data consistency
- Makes maintenance and updates more difficult

<div class="notes">
Current PhilHealth e-claims systems often use Application Programming Interfaces or APIs but are not compliant with the standardized FHIR messaging standard. The failure to adopt FHIR standards risks creating a proliferation of multiple non-standard API endpoints, meaning that each system integration requires custom development work. This significantly increases development costs and complexity while reducing system reliability and data consistency. It also makes maintenance and updates more difficult and expensive. Without standardization, the healthcare IT ecosystem becomes fragmented, with each vendor creating proprietary interfaces that don't communicate well with other systems, perpetuating the very fragmentation that UHC aims to eliminate.
</div>

## Cost of Non-Adoption: Systemic Impact

- Fragmented data disrupts continuity of care
- Non-networked facilities create health system blind spots
- Loss of quality and safety benefits
- Health information cannot be seamlessly exchanged
- Compromises systemic care quality and safety
- Impaired decision-making due to inaccessible data
- Poor quality and untimely data reporting

<div class="notes">
The costs of non-adoption extend beyond mere technological inconvenience and undermine the core objectives of UHC. Non-adoption or use of non-interoperable systems perpetuates fragmented data systems that disrupt the continuity of care. Non-networked facilities create blind spots that impede health system management. Lack of interoperability and mandatory data sharing means that health information cannot be seamlessly exchanged, which compromises systemic care quality and safety benefits for individual Filipinos. Valuable data is unavailable because it is buried in inaccessible silos. This results in poor quality and untimely generation and reporting of health and health-related data, which severely impairs data-driven management, policy decision-making, and research.
</div>

---

## Cost of Non-Adoption: Operational Impact

- Increased workload and inefficiency for healthcare workers
- High data entry burden reduces capacity to deliver care
- Double or triple encoding wastes valuable time
- Resources diverted from direct patient care
- Staff burnout due to administrative burden
- Inability to track utilization of essential services
- Hinders monitoring and evaluation efforts

<div class="notes">
Healthcare workers routinely face the burden of using multiple systems, often requiring double or even triple encoding of the same information when interoperability is lacking. This high data entry burden reduces the capacity of health workers to deliver care. Staff burnout occurs due to the administrative burden of managing multiple non-integrated systems. Resources that should be focused on direct patient care are instead diverted to redundant data entry tasks. Non-adoption also limits the ability to track the utilization of essential primary care services, hindering monitoring and evaluation efforts essential for UHC success. The operational inefficiencies create a vicious cycle where healthcare workers become frustrated with technology that should be helping them but instead creates more work.
</div>

---

## Cost of Non-Adoption: Regulatory and Financial

- Licensing and contracting risk:
  - Data submission via HIS required for DOH license
  - Required for PhilHealth accreditation
- Loss of incentives and delayed payments
- PhilHealth links payment to compliant EMR submissions
- Non-compliance risks delays in claims processing
- Loss of performance-based incentives
- Financial sustainability of healthcare facilities at risk

<div class="notes">
The submission of health data via HIS is explicitly a requirement in the licensing and contracting arrangements for health facilities. Non-compliance can risk both a provider's DOH license and PhilHealth accreditation, which could effectively shut down a healthcare facility's operations. PhilHealth intends to link provider payment speed or differentials and disincentives to the exclusive use of compliant, EMR-generated submissions recorded at the point of care. Non-compliance risks delays in PhilHealth claims or loss of performance-based incentives. This puts the financial sustainability of healthcare facilities at risk, particularly smaller rural health units and municipal hospitals that depend heavily on PhilHealth reimbursements to maintain operations.

## Summary of Key Takeaways

- UHC Law requires interoperable EMRs
- National standards: FHIR and SNOMED-CT
- Implementation challenged by:
  - Fragmented systems
  - Severe HR shortages
  - Insufficient funding and infrastructure
  - Reliance on paper and double-encoding
- Effective HIS essential for UHC goals
- Equitable, efficient, transparent health services depend on EMR success

<div class="notes">
Let me summarize the key takeaways from this presentation. The UHC Law fundamentally requires interoperable EMRs anchored in national standards like FHIR and SNOMED-CT. However, implementation remains challenged by fragmented systems, severe human resource shortages, and insufficient funding and infrastructure, forcing continued reliance on paper-based systems and double-encoding. Effective HIS implementation is essential for realizing UHC goals of equitable, efficient, and transparent health services. Without proper EMR adoption, the vision of universal health care for all Filipinos cannot be fully realized. The success of UHC is intrinsically linked to the success of EMR implementation across the healthcare system.

- Ensure policy continuity and enforcement
- Secure dedicated HIS budget lines within DOH and PhilHealth
- Link PhilHealth reimbursements to HIS adoption
- Incentivize standards-compliant EMR use
- Create permanent digital health positions in hospitals and RHUs
- Provide ongoing EMR support, configuration, and data stewardship

<div class="notes">
To strengthen EMR implementation and achieve UHC goals, several priority actions must be taken. First, require cabinet-level participation in inter-agency steering committees to ensure policy continuity and enforcement across government agencies. Second, secure dedicated HIS budget lines within DOH and PhilHealth appropriations to ensure sustainable funding. Third, link PhilHealth reimbursements to HIS adoption and standards-compliant EMR use to create strong financial incentives for compliance. Finally, create permanent digital health positions, or plantilla items, in hospitals and Rural Health Units to oversee EMR implementation and provide ongoing support, configuration, data stewardship, user help, and connectivity management. These actions will help transform EMR implementation from a struggling mandate to a functioning reality that supports universal health care for all Filipinos.
