**Policy Memorandum: The Strategic Imperative for Digital Health Transformation** **From Software Carpenter to System Architect: A Unified Approach to Achieving Interoperable Universal Health Care**

**Target Audience:** The Secretary of Health, Cabinet Secretaries, and Top Country Leaders

### I. Introduction and Strategic Thesis

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act (Republic Act No. 11223) mandates a robust, integrated Health Information System (HIS) as the infrastructural backbone for achieving equitable access to quality care. While the initial strategy involved the Department of Health (DOH) providing free software, such as iClinicSys and iHOMIS, this tactical approach is now fundamentally misaligned with UHC goals and constitutes a barrier to national digital health maturity.

The current model:

1. **Imposes a burden** on frontline healthcare workers by prioritizing national **reporting requirements** over operational clinical efficiency.
2. **Stifles market innovation** and disincentivizes the health IT sector from providing fit-for-purpose, interoperable EMR solutions for the public sector.
3. **Diverts DOH resources** from its paramount role as the **overall leader of the health sector**—the architect, regulator, and enforcer of national standards.

**This position paper argues that the DOH must urgently transition its function from being a software \*carpenter\* to becoming the definitive system \*architect\* of digital health infrastructure. Success depends on focusing exclusively on setting and enforcing mandatory standards and policy, thereby enabling the health IT market and Local Government Units (LGUs) to assume responsibility for implementing operational EMR applications.**

### II. Foundational Arguments: Why the Current Model Must Change

#### A. The Financial Rationale for Free Software is Invalidated by the UHC Act

The necessity for the DOH to develop and provide EMR software "at no cost" was predicated on the assumption that LGUs lacked financial capacity. This justification is now untenable under the UHC financing framework:

- **Explicit Mandate for Health IT Investment:** The UHC Act mandates the creation of the **Special Health Fund (SHF)** for all Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). The utilization guidelines for the SHF explicitly permit allocation for **Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology**.
- **Local Accountability through Planning:** LGUs are required to outline their investment priorities, including **health information management/ICT systems**, in their **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**. LGUs choosing non-DOH systems are required to **shoulder all related costs using their own administrative funds**.
- **Conclusion:** The resources and legal mechanism for LGUs to procure market-driven, operational Health IT solutions are already embedded in the UHC financing structure. If the DOH cannot service the **entire public health sector** efficiently—as demonstrated by persistent underutilization, fragmentation, and technical support challenges—it must step aside and enable LGUs to deploy their allotted SHF resources to the Health IT market for superior service delivery.

#### B. Functional Gaps and Service Inefficiency Burden the Frontline

Current DOH systems are not meeting the operational demands of the UHC initiative, resulting in inefficient workflows and low user acceptance, which actively hinders UHC integration:

- **Reporting vs. Operation:** Assessment findings indicate that DOH EMRs are commonly viewed as merely **"data gathering and reporting"** tools designed around the "statistician's requirement at the national level," rather than optimizing clinical workflow.
- **System Fragmentation:** The presence of functionally deficient DOH systems alongside local alternatives leads to pervasive reliance on non-integrated methods (e.g., continuing use of paper or reliance on **Google Forms aggregate collection systems**) and the **burden of double or triple encoding** patient data.
- **Private Sector Innovation:** The private sector, unburdened by mandatory government EMR use, has demonstrated the capacity to develop systems providing "satisfactory performance" and dependable support. By acting as a developer, the DOH unfairly competes with and discourages the entry of higher-quality private solutions that could otherwise support UHC compliance.

#### C. The DOH Must Prioritize its Non-Negotiable Stewardship Role

The DOH’s mandated core responsibilities—which demand significant resources and strategic focus—are neglected when attention is devoted to application software development and maintenance:

- **Lead Architect Role:** The DOH’s paramount role is leading the health sector in defining **policy direction, technical standards, and enforcement**. This involves highly technical, non-delegable tasks like leading the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework development, institutionalizing **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**, and strengthening **health promotion governance**.
- **Architectural Focus:** DOH capacity should be entirely dedicated to enforcing mandatory adoption of **National Health Data Standards for Interoperability** and deploying **foundational registries**—the critical components of the proposed **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)**. This is the necessary digital infrastructure that facilitates evidence-based policymaking (e.g., publishing **annual provincial burden of disease (BOD) estimates**).

### III. Priority Recommendations: A Roadmap for Digital Health Transformation

To secure the data-driven foundations of UHC, the following priority recommendations, synthesized from the UHC-IS assessment and UHC mandates, are directed towards the DOH and top country leaders:

| Priority                                           | Recommendation                                               | DOH/Stakeholder Action & Rationale                           | Basis in Sources |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **1. Strengthen Governance & Leadership**          | **Secure Cabinet-Level Leadership for Digital Health**       | The President must issue an Executive Order or directive ensuring **cabinet-level participation** (or alternates with clear written authority to make binding decisions) in the inter-agency steering committee on digital health. This is a **priority recommendation** to enforce accountability and protect long-term HIS reforms from political turnover. |                  |
|                                                    | **Institutionalize Local HIS Committees**                    | The DILG and DOH must mandate the creation of **HIS Committees** within Local Health Boards to oversee EMR implementation, interoperability compliance, and data quality assurance at the LGU level, ensuring that health ICT needs are aligned with the LGU’s **Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP)**. |                  |
| **2. Enforce Financial Accountability & Strategy** | **Mandate EMR Roadmaps in the LIPH**                         | DOH (BLHSD/KMITS) and DILG must revise the **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH) template** to require inclusion of **EMR implementation roadmaps, staff training plans, and interoperability compliance** as standard investment needs. This enforces the local strategic allocation of the **SHF** for quality Health IT procurement. |                  |
|                                                    | **Fast-Track Transition to Managed Services**                | DOH must immediately **fast-track the transition to a managed service model** for ubiquitous EMRs (iClinicSys, iHOMIS). This addresses endemic usability and acceptance issues and re-allocates DOH resources toward policy enforcement rather than application support. |                  |
| **3. Leverage Financial Incentives (PhilHealth)**  | **Tie Reimbursements to Standards Compliance & Sunset Interim Systems** | PhilHealth must leverage its contracts to **embed incentives and disincentives** that **reward real-time, standards-compliant EMR use** and **require exclusive use of interoperable systems**. PhilHealth must set a **firm timeline to discontinue the interim eKonsulta solution** and accelerate the accreditation of validated third-party EMR providers. |                  |
| **4. Institutionalize Digital Architecture**       | **Prioritize Foundational Registries and FHIR**              | DOH must prioritize investment and deployment of **foundational registries** and mandatory adoption of **HL7 FHIR messaging standards** as articulated in the NHDR and OpenHIE framework. DOH must establish a **test bed for EMR providers** to validate their systems against mandatory interoperability standards before deployment. |                  |
| **5. Sustain Regulatory and Workforce Capacity**   | **Pass the eHealth/Digital Health Law and Create Permanent Positions** | The legislature must pass an **eHealth/Digital Health Law** that provides statutory backing for the governance structure, prioritized core data sets, standards, and the conformance pathway for interoperability. This must be complemented by the creation of **permanent digital health positions** (e.g., CIOs and specialized IT personnel) in hospitals and RHUs, leveraging the **National Health Workforce Support System (NHWSS)** framework to overcome existing Personal Services (PS) cap barriers. |                  |

### IV. Conclusion

Achieving Universal Health Care depends on robust, interoperable, and patient-centric information flow. The DOH must recognize that its success is not measured by the number of software applications it develops, but by its capacity to govern the entire digital ecosystem. By making the strategic pivot from software *carpenter* to digital *architect*, the DOH will redirect precious national resources towards the necessary policy, regulatory, and architectural work that provides the sustainable, accountable, and evidence-based foundation for UHC. This decisive shift will ensure that health data is transformed into a universal public good, enabling better policy, efficient resource allocation, and a responsive health system for all Filipinos.
