# What is SCIV?

The acronym **SCIV** stands for **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation**.

Here is a comprehensive overview of what SCIV is, how systems comply with it, and its current status:

### What is SCIV?

**SCIV is a process of verification and compliance monitoring for Health Information Systems (HIS) and other eHealth solutions**.

1. **Definition and Purpose:**
   - SCIV is the **process of confirmation of conformance with national health data standards for interoperability** and **compliance with rules on processing and submission of health and health-related data and reports**.
   - It functions as a **compliance monitoring mechanism** intended to achieve an integrated and interoperable health and health-related data and report processing and submission across all levels of healthcare utilization.
   - The goal of SCIV is to verify that HIS conforms to national health data standards and complies with rules on data processing and submission at both local (within and across Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems [P/CWHS]) and national levels (to the Department of Health [DOH] and/or Philippine Health Insurance Corporation [PhilHealth]).
   - The validation process aims to address prevailing inaccuracies and inconsistencies in local and national health data reporting, preventing widespread managerial and operational inefficiencies that often result from implementers using different information systems, data definitions, terminologies, elements, and structures.
2. **Foundational Policy and Governance:**
   - The implementation of SCIV was institutionalized by the **DOH, PhilHealth, and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT)** through **Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2021-0001**.
   - The DOH, PhilHealth, and DICT are the lead administrators of the SCIV process.
   - They established the SCIV Technical Working Group (TWG) to define implementation strategies and standards and oversee monitoring through bi-annual assessments.

### How Do Systems Comply with SCIV?

Compliance requires that all relevant entities subject their health information systems and eHealth solutions to the validation process.

1. **Mandatory Requirements:**
   - All health care providers, insurers, and health-related entities implementing or planning to implement an HIS and/or other eHealth solutions are **required to undergo and pass SCIV**. This applies regardless of the type of system development (in-house vs. outsourced), ownership (government-owned vs. private-owned), or stage of implementation.
   - For a system to be compliant, it must meet three minimum requirements under the Enterprise Architecture Implementation Area: demonstrate a fully functional, integrated HIS; comply with national health standards for interoperability; and **pass the DOH, PhilHealth, and DICT Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation**.
   - Systems must conform and comply with minimum uniform standards on **enterprise architecture, cybersecurity, data privacy, and ICT service management** set by DOH and PhilHealth, as mandated by the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act.
   - If the system passes the SCIV testing, the application software is designated as a **validated module**, confirming that the minimum scope, standards, and level of functionality are met.
2. **Process and Documentation:**
   - Applicants may initiate the process through the **Centralized Online Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation System** or by submitting an accomplished application form to their respective Regional SCIV Administrators. No cost is currently charged for SCIV applicants.
   - The process utilizes an **SCIV Toolkit**, which provides the process guide, requirements checklist, technical specifications/scripts, and standards references.
   - Upon completion of the SCIV testing, Regional SCIV Administrators notify the applicant of the results and recommendations within three working days.
   - A certificate is issued to applicants whose application software has passed the SCIV testing, serving as proof that compliance requirements have been met. This certificate remains valid unless revoked, suspended, or if new amendments or internal software changes are instituted.
   - If an applicant disagrees with the SCIV results, they may appeal the decision through the Centralized Online SCIV System or by submitting an appeal form to the Regional SCIV Administrators.

### What is the Current Status?

1. **System Development and Transition:**
   - The **Centralized Online SCIV System** is currently **"In development / Not yet used"**. Data from the preceding system is still being transferred.
   - The predecessor, the **National eHealth Electronic Health Record Validation System (NEHEHRVS)**, is currently used to validate hospital Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for DOH reporting compliance, but it is slated for **decommissioning** once the Centralized Online SCIV System is fully implemented.
2. **Regulatory Compliance Timeline:**
   - The requirement for all health care providers and insurers to implement and maintain an integrated HIS (which includes subjecting systems to SCIV) was set to form part of their respective licensing and accreditation requirements starting in **October 2022**.
3. **Recommendations and Functionality:**
   - The SCIV framework is important, as, in principle, it enables validated third-party EMRs to transmit data and interoperate with the **Routine Information and Statistics for Enhancement of Public Health (RISE PH)** Repository System.
   - However, a recent assessment recommended that the DOH conduct a policy review of the SCIV framework to include foundational technical elements, standardized testing scripts, and specific implementation guidelines to ensure health information systems can achieve true interoperability.
   - The SCIV program is intended to be monitored monthly by Regional SCIV Administrators and evaluated every two years by the SCIV TWG to ensure effectiveness relative to the UHC Act goals.
