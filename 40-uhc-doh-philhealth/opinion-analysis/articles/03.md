## Build It Where Care Happens: The Case for a Federated Network of Networks

When the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) was conceptualized, it was supposed to be the technological backbone of Universal Health Care (UHC). Instead, it’s become a policy artifact — a national database that doesn’t exist.
Two years in, the failure to even start implementation isn’t a question of funding or skill. It’s a question of architecture.

The truth is simple: **the Philippines can’t build a single, centralized national data repository first and expect it to work.**
The NHDR must be built from the ground up — from the province-wide and city-wide health systems where care actually happens. It should be a **federated network of networks**, not a single top-down database.

### Where Health Data Really Lives

Every patient encounter, every referral, every lab result, every claim — all of it starts locally.
Data originates in clinics, hospitals, rural health units, and community health centers. It’s created during care, stored in EMRs, LIS, and HIS systems, and used to make daily operational decisions.

That’s the living health information ecosystem.
And yet, the original NHDR concept ignored this completely. It imagined that all these facilities would somehow upload their data to a central national system “for policy and planning.”

But local health systems — the Province- and City-Wide Health Systems (P/CWHS) mandated under the UHC Act — were never designed to be passive data reporters. They are **the lawful custodians** of their population’s health data. They have the governance authority, the operational context, and the accountability for service delivery.

If data doesn’t serve them first, it serves no one.

------

### The Case Against Centralization

The temptation to centralize is understandable. A single national repository sounds efficient — one source of truth, one place to secure, one system to manage.
But in practice, centralization in health data is an illusion.

Here’s why it fails:

1. **It ignores data gravity.**
Health data is massive and constantly generated. The cost and complexity of moving it all to a central location is impractical — especially with unstable connectivity in many areas.
2. **It breaks local ownership.**
When you take data away from the people who generated it, you also take away their incentive to maintain its accuracy. Local health offices stop caring once they lose control of their own data.
3. **It can’t keep up with real-time needs.**
National-level systems move at bureaucratic speed. Providers need information now — for referrals, diagnostics, and continuity of care — not quarterly uploads to a distant server.
4. **It’s politically fragile.**
Centralized systems depend on continuous national funding and stable leadership — both of which are unpredictable. Decentralized systems, governed locally, survive political transitions.

Centralized repositories always promise control. They almost never deliver function.

### What a Federated NHDR Looks Like

A **federated NHDR** is a network of interconnected networks. Each P/CWHS operates its own health information exchange (HIE), responsible for managing and sharing health data within its jurisdiction.
These local HIEs connect upward through an interoperability layer to synchronize with national systems for analytics, policymaking, and surveillance.

In simple terms:

- **Local systems handle the care.**
- **National systems handle the insight.**

The data remains locally owned, but it’s accessible securely for legitimate, authorized purposes across the network.

------

### How It Works

1. **Province- and City-Wide Health Systems (P/CWHS)**
Each P/CWHS manages its own shared health record, covering both public and private providers in its area. Referrals, laboratory results, and claims data move through this local network in real time.
2. **Interoperability Layer (HIE)**
This layer handles routing, translation, and validation. It ensures that all systems — EMRs, HIS, LIS, and claims portals — use common identifiers (PhilHealth ID, NHFR code, PSGC, etc.) and standard terminologies.
3. **Foundational Registries**
Patient, facility, provider, and terminology registries serve as the backbone for matching and linking records. Each registry has a national master source but synchronizes copies at the local level.
4. **National NHDR Services**
The national NHDR doesn’t store all patient records. It aggregates **de-identified, summary-level data** from local exchanges for policy, planning, and analytics. It functions as an orchestration layer, not a warehouse.

This is the model used by OpenHIE, a globally proven framework that powers health data exchanges in countries like Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia — all of which, like the Philippines, have devolved health governance structures.

------

### Why This Approach Works

1. **It aligns with UHC governance.**
The UHC Act devolves health service management to P/CWHS. The federated model respects that structure, making data governance match the law.
2. **It delivers value where it matters.**
Local data exchanges improve care coordination — smoother referrals, shared lab results, faster claims. That’s the value that drives adoption.
3. **It’s scalable and resilient.**
Each P/CWHS can develop at its own pace, depending on capacity. National systems can still see the big picture through summarized data.
4. **It’s politically sustainable.**
A federated architecture can survive leadership changes. Even if national priorities shift, local exchanges keep operating because they serve daily clinical and administrative needs.
5. **It supports trust and privacy.**
Data stays close to where it’s created, with clear custodianship. Access is controlled through shared governance and audit logs, making compliance with the Data Privacy Act manageable.

------

### Why It’s the Only Practical Path Forward

There’s a hard truth here: the Philippines doesn’t have the infrastructure or manpower to build a single, centralized health data repository. But it *does* have functioning local systems — hospitals, LGUs, and PhilHealth regional offices — that already generate digital health data every day.

The NHDR should leverage that existing activity.
Instead of forcing everyone to send data to a central point, it should help them connect their systems to one another. That’s how interoperability starts — not through decree, but through exchange.

------

### The Building Blocks

To make a federated NHDR real, three things must happen immediately:

1. **Start with pilot provinces.**
Choose 2–3 P/CWHS to serve as reference implementations. Establish their local exchanges, connect them to national registries, and use their data to test the interoperability layer.
2. **Define governance clearly.**
Each level — facility, local government, national agency — must know its role as custodian, processor, or steward. Data sharing agreements and legal frameworks should formalize this.
3. **Build technical capacity locally.**
Fund regional implementation teams that include IT officers, data managers, and privacy specialists. Don’t rely solely on Manila-based teams to run the system.

This approach may seem slower than a centralized rollout, but it’s the only one that actually scales.

------

### A Network That Learns

A federated NHDR isn’t just about architecture; it’s about feedback.
When data moves both ways — from the clinic to the policymaker and back — the entire system becomes self-correcting.
Facilities see how their data affects regional health outcomes. Policymakers see where gaps exist in real time.

That loop — not a database — is the real heart of interoperability.

------

### The Way Forward

The NHDR has a chance to be redefined before it becomes another failed IT project.
To succeed, it must stop trying to *collect* health data and start trying to *connect* health systems.

A network of networks isn’t just a technical choice; it’s a philosophical one.
It says that health reform starts where people get care — not where reports are consolidated.
It says that data belongs first to those who use it, not just those who regulate it.
It says that the path to universal health care isn’t through a central server in Manila — it’s through every clinic, hospital, and health office that chooses to connect.
