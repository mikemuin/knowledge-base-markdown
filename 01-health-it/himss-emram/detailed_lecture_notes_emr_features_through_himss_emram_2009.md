Different AI Version

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**"What Are the Features of an EMR? A Progressive Journey Through HIMSS EMRAM 2009"**

### Lecturer Introduction:

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're going to explore one of the most fundamental questions in healthcare IT: "What are the features of an EMR?" But we're not going to answer this in the traditional way by simply listing features. Instead, we're going to take you on a progressive journey that shows how EMR features evolve systematically from basic functionality to world-class healthcare intelligence.

### Context Setting:

Many healthcare professionals ask this question when considering EMR implementation, but the answer isn't straightforward because EMR features aren't static - they build progressively. What we'll discover today is that an EMR at Stage 1 has very different capabilities than an EMR at Stage 7, and understanding this progression is crucial for strategic planning and implementation success.

### Presentation Overview:

We'll use the HIMSS EMRAM 2009 model as our framework, examining how features build from basic departmental systems to advanced population health analytics. Each stage has a specific strategic intent, and the features at each level are designed to achieve that intent while preparing for the next level of capability.

------

## Slide 2: Understanding EMR Features Through Progressive Stages

### Key Learning Objective:

Students need to understand that EMR features aren't developed arbitrarily - they follow a logical, progressive sequence that builds capability systematically.

### Detailed Explanation:

**EMR Definition Context:** When we talk about EMR features, we're not discussing a single software application, but rather an ecosystem of integrated capabilities that evolve over time. Think of it like a city's infrastructure - you don't build highways before you have roads, and you don't build advanced public transportation before you have basic connectivity.

**Progressive Development Concept:** This is crucial to understand: EMR features must build in a specific sequence because each stage creates the foundation for the next. You can't have advanced clinical decision support without integrated data, and you can't have integrated data without basic electronic systems generating that data.

**HIMSS EMRAM Framework:** The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) developed this framework after studying hundreds of hospitals and identifying common patterns in successful EMR implementations. The 2009 version added Stage 7, recognizing that true EMR excellence requires population health capabilities.

**Feature Categories Preview:** We'll examine five main categories: data capture and storage (the foundation), integration and interoperability (connecting systems), clinical decision support (making data intelligent), workflow optimization (improving efficiency), and analytics and intelligence (strategic capabilities).

### Discussion Questions for Audience:

- How many of you have worked with EMR systems at different stages of maturity?
- What challenges have you experienced when EMR features weren't properly integrated?

------

## Slide 3: The Foundation: From Paper to Digital

### Contextual Setup:

Before we dive into EMR features, we need to establish our baseline. Many healthcare institutions, particularly in rural Philippines, still operate significantly with paper-based processes.

### Detailed Explanation:

**Stage 0 Reality:** This isn't just a theoretical starting point - many healthcare facilities worldwide still operate at Stage 0. In the Philippine context, this includes numerous rural hospitals, some district hospitals, and smaller private clinics. Understanding Stage 0 is crucial because it defines what we're transforming FROM.

**Manual Process Challenges:** At Stage 0, clinical staff face significant challenges: illegible handwriting leads to medication errors, lost charts delay patient care, duplicate testing occurs due to missing results, and quality measurement is nearly impossible without aggregated data. These challenges drive the need for EMR features.

**Transformation Goals:** Each goal represents a category of EMR features we'll develop: replacing paper charts requires documentation features, automating workflows needs integration features, enabling data-driven decisions demands analytics features, and improving safety requires clinical decision support features.

**Setting Expectations:** The journey from Stage 0 to Stage 7 isn't just about technology - it's about transforming healthcare delivery. Each stage requires significant organizational change, staff training, and process redesign.

### Real-World Examples:

Share examples of hospitals you've worked with that started at Stage 0 and the challenges they faced. This helps the audience relate to the content and understand the practical implications.

## Slide 19: Stage 4: Why Electronic Prescribing Revolutionizes Safety

### Safety Revolution Analysis:

Understanding the profound safety impact of electronic prescribing on healthcare quality.

### Detailed Explanation:

**Error Prevention at the Source:** Electronic prescribing prevents errors at their source rather than trying to catch them downstream. Handwriting errors, dosing mistakes, and drug interactions are prevented during order entry rather than discovered later when they're harder and more expensive to correct.

**Clinical Intelligence Integration:** The real power of electronic prescribing isn't just legibility - it's the integration of clinical intelligence. The system "knows" about the patient's allergies, current medications, kidney function, and other relevant factors, providing personalized clinical guidance for each prescribing decision.

**Systematic Safety Enhancement:** Unlike paper-based safety measures that depend on individual memory and vigilance, electronic prescribing creates systematic safety checks that work consistently for every patient, every time. This systematic approach dramatically improves overall medication safety.

**Quality Assurance Integration:** Built-in quality measures ensure automatic compliance with clinical guidelines and accreditation standards. This systematic approach to quality is more reliable than depending on individual memory and vigilance.

**Resource Optimization:** Intelligent ordering reduces waste through appropriate utilization guidelines, duplicate checking, and evidence-based protocols. This optimization improves cost-effectiveness while maintaining or improving quality.

**Systematic Improvement Capability:** Electronic ordering creates data that enables systematic analysis and improvement of care protocols. Hospitals can identify what works best and continuously refine their care delivery processes.

### Outcome Improvements:

Share specific evidence: hospitals implementing Stage 5 typically see 15-20% reduction in length of stay, 25% reduction in unnecessary testing, 30% improvement in clinical guideline compliance, and 10-15% improvement in patient satisfaction.

### The Next Challenge:

While ordering is now comprehensive and standardized, there's still no verification that ordered care is actually delivered as intended. This gap between ordering and delivery creates the need for Stage 6's closed-loop verification capabilities.

Stage 1 creates the electronic data streams that become the raw material for all advanced EMR features.

**Why Stage 2 Next - Integration Prerequisite:** Advanced clinical features require integrated patient information. Without a unified view of patient data, clinical decision support is incomplete and potentially dangerous. Stage 2 creates the integrated data foundation necessary for comprehensive clinical features.

**Why Stage 3 Then - Complete Clinical Picture:** Before optimizing specific clinical processes, you need comprehensive documentation of patient care. Partial information leads to suboptimal clinical decisions. Stage 3 provides the complete clinical picture necessary for intelligent process optimization.

**Why Stage 4 Focus - Risk-Based Prioritization:** Medication errors cause more preventable deaths than any other healthcare error type. By addressing the highest-risk processes first, organizations achieve maximum safety impact and build confidence for broader EMR implementation.

**Why Stage 5 Expansion - Systematic Standardization:** Building on medication ordering success, Stage 5 applies proven electronic ordering benefits to all clinical services. This systematic approach ensures consistent quality and safety across all care processes.

**Why Stage 6 Verification - Accountability Requirement:** Electronic ordering is meaningless without verification that ordered care is delivered correctly. Stage 6 closes the loop between intention and delivery, ensuring complete accountability.

**Why Stage 7 Analytics - Population Health Capability:** Only after optimizing individual patient care can organizations effectively address population health. Stage 7 leverages optimized clinical processes to improve community health outcomes.
