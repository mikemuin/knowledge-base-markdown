## Position Paper: Shifting the Paradigm—The National Government’s Role in Digital Health Must Transition from Software Developer to Architect of Standards

### I. Introduction and Thesis

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act (Republic Act No. 11223) establishes a robust and integrated Health Information System (HIS) as essential infrastructure for achieving equitable health outcomes. While the law permits the Department of Health (DOH) and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) to develop and finance information systems "at no cost" for resource-constrained entities, this approach—manifested primarily through systems like iClinicSys and iHOMIS—is fundamentally undermining UHC objectives.

This position paper asserts that the provision of free government software, intended as a measure of equity, actually **hinders the realization of UHC objectives** by stifling market innovation, burdening frontline workers with operationally deficient tools, and diverting critical national resources away from the DOH’s true mandate: **establishing and enforcing mandatory, interoperable national standards**. Crucially, the argument that Local Government Units (LGUs) lack the means to invest in quality Health IT is invalidated by the UHC Act’s financial mechanisms. The DOH must urgently cease its role as the software *carpenter* and embrace its indispensable function as the digital *road map architect*.

### II. Foundational Arguments: The Conflict of Roles

#### A. Operational Deficiencies and the Burden of Data Gathering

The free software provided by the government often fails to function as a seamless operational Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, thereby undermining the continuity of care demanded by UHC.

1. **Prioritizing Reporting over Care:** User experiences detailed in assessment studies confirm that DOH EMRs were designed predominantly for the "statistician's requirement at the national level" rather than the needs of frontline clinicians. This design limitation leads to the perception that the software is merely a **"data gathering and reporting tool"**, which health workers view as an "added burden" because it does not translate into discernible benefits at the regional operations level.
2. **Systemic Fragmentation:** The poor usability of these centralized, free systems contributes directly to fragmented data collection practices, forcing healthcare workers into the burden of **double or triple encoding** patient information (e.g., in local EMRs, PhilHealth systems, and DOH systems). This inefficiency is evidenced by the continued use of non-standard methods like **Google Forms aggregate collection systems** for FHSIS reports.

#### B. The Special Health Fund (SHF) Negates the Rationale for Free DOH Software

The core justification for the DOH developing and providing free software—that LGUs lack financial capacity—is directly contradicted by the financing structure established under the UHC Act.

1. **The SHF Mandate:** The UHC Act explicitly requires the creation of the **Special Health Fund (SHF)** for Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). This fund, managed by the Provincial/City Health Board (P/CHB), pools DOH financial grants and income derived from PhilHealth payments.
2. **Health IT as Allowable Investment:** The utilization guidelines for the SHF explicitly list **"Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology"** as an allowable expenditure category. Therefore, the LGUs committed to UHC integration are provided with the financial mechanism to procure, implement, and maintain high-quality, market-driven Health IT solutions.
3. **Strategic Resource Allocation:** The P/CHB determines the allocation and utilization of the SHF based on the strategic plan outlined in the **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**. This framework is designed to empower LGUs to identify specific investment needs for Health IT systems. If the DOH were to step aside from being a mass developer, the LGUs would be compelled to make better, strategic use of the funds already mandated to go their way.

#### C. Stifling the Health IT Market and Undermining Stewardship

The government’s decision to remain in the software development and support business creates distortions that inhibit superior solutions from reaching the public health sector.

1. **DOH as Architect, Not Developer:** The DOH's **core responsibility** as the "overall leader of the health sector" is to set the national policy direction, technical standards, and enforcement mechanisms. This includes institutionalizing the **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** process and defining **National Health Data Standards for Interoperability**. These architectural and regulatory functions are critically jeopardized when the DOH spends resources and political capital supporting internally-developed applications like iClinicSys and iHOMIS.
2. **Disadvantage to Public Health:** Because the private health sector is not compelled to use DOH software, it has been free to adopt and innovate using commercial systems that provide "satisfactory performance". The public sector, constrained by the existence of a free, yet often insufficient, government alternative, is hindered from accessing superior operational EMRs that meet the demands of modern clinical care. The inability of the DOH to effectively service and support the whole public health sector thus does a disservice to all LGUs attempting to implement UHC.

### III. Core Positions

#### Position 1: The National Government Must Focus on Policy, Regulation, and Standards, Not Software Development.

The DOH’s role must be exclusively focused on the architectural framework required for integrated governance. The DOH must transition from software *carpenter* to *road map architect*.

- **Prioritize Foundational Components:** DOH must prioritize investment and deployment of **foundational registries**—including terminology services, client registry, health facility registry—and accelerate the enforcement of global standards like **HL7 FHIR messaging**.
- **Enforce SCIV Rigorously:** The DOH must strengthen the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework to include standardized testing scripts and technical elements necessary for health information systems to achieve **true interoperability**.

#### Position 2: LGUs Must Strategically Utilize the Special Health Fund (SHF) for Quality Health IT Investments.

The financial autonomy granted by the SHF should be exercised by LGUs to procure high-quality, standards-compliant EMRs from the private market.

- **Mandate EMR Roadmaps in LIPH:** DOH and DILG must jointly mandate the inclusion of **EMR implementation roadmaps, staff training plans, and interoperability compliance** as standard requirements within the Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH) template. This links local strategic planning (LIPH) directly to the mandated use of the SHF for capital investments in IT.
- **Embrace Market Service:** If the DOH cannot provide end-to-end, high-quality technical support, training, and maintenance across the entire public health sector, it must step aside and let the commercial Health IT market service public health, using SHF and LGU counterpart funds for procurement.

#### Position 3: PhilHealth Must Be the Enforcement Mechanism Driving Digital Compliance.

PhilHealth’s financial power, designed to support the system, must be leveraged to enforce digital compliance and data quality across all providers, public and private.

- **Incentivize Adoption:** PhilHealth must use its contracts to incentivize the incorporation of health information systems, automation of clinical information, and improvement of data quality.
- **Sunset Inefficient Systems:** PhilHealth must establish a firm timeline to **discontinue the interim eKonsulta solution** and accelerate the accreditation of EMR providers capable of deploying validated systems to eliminate redundant data entry and enforce the use of SCIV-compliant EMRs.

### IV. Recommendations: The Architect’s Roadmap

To transition the DOH’s role and accelerate UHC objectives, the following actions must be prioritized:

| Priority                          | Action                                                       | Responsibility  | Basis in Sources |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **I. Standards & Architecture**   | **1. Prioritize Foundational Registries:** Immediately invest in and deploy OpenHIE-articulated foundational registries (e.g., terminology services, client registry) and HL7 FHIR messaging standards. | DOH             |                  |
|                                   | **2. Strengthen Interoperability Enforcement:** Rigorously review and update the SCIV framework to include clear technical elements and testing scripts necessary for *true* interoperability. | DOH             |                  |
| **II. Financial & LGU Strategy**  | **3. Mandate Health IT in LIPH:** Require that the LIPH template mandate EMR implementation roadmaps and staff training plans, ensuring SHF funds are dedicated to appropriate Health IT capital investments. | DOH, DILG, LGUs |                  |
|                                   | **4. Enforce SHF Utilization Tracking:** Implement the SHF utilization tracking system to ensure funds are optimally utilized for system development, including Health IT. | DOH, PhilHealth |                  |
| **III. Operational & Transition** | **5.
