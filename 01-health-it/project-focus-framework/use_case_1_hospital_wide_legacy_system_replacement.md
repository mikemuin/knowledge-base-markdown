# Use Case 1: Hospital-wide Legacy System Replacement

## Applying the Healthcare IT Project Focus Framework

### Scenario

A 400-bed hospital needs to replace legacy IT systems (HIS, EMR, LIS, RIS, ERP) that "cannot keep up with future directions."

------

## Step 1: Core Foundation Questions

### What are the problems that need to be solved?

**Initial Problem Statement:** "Legacy systems cannot keep up with future directions"

**Framework Application - Problem Clarification:**

- **What's the ONE core problem?** *Systems cannot support required clinical workflows and regulatory compliance*
- **What happens if we do nothing?** *Regulatory non-compliance, patient safety risks, operational inefficiencies*
- **Must solve vs. nice to solve?** *Must solve: regulatory compliance, patient safety. Nice to solve: staff convenience features*
- **What are we NOT fixing?** *Organizational workflow problems, staff training gaps*

**Refined Problem Statement:** Legacy systems cannot support DOH regulatory requirements and PhilHealth integration, creating compliance risks and operational inefficiencies that impact patient care quality.

### What are the success criteria?

- **Primary:** 100% regulatory compliance within 18 months
- **Secondary:** 25% reduction in duplicate data entry by staff
- **Tertiary:** Real-time clinical decision support available to physicians
- **Failure criteria:** Any system downtime exceeding 4 hours during transition

### What does success look like?

**One-sentence vision:** Hospital operates on integrated, compliant systems that support clinical excellence and efficient operations.

## Step 2: Multi-Domain Perspective Check

| Domain        | Problem                              | Success Criteria                  | Vision                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Financial** | Compliance fines, operational waste  | ROI positive by year 3            | Cost-effective operations      |
| **Patient**   | Data accuracy, care continuity       | Zero patient safety incidents     | Seamless care experience       |
| **Staff**     | Manual processes, system frustration | 25% time savings on documentation | Efficient workflows            |
| **Doctor**    | Limited decision support             | Clinical alerts in real-time      | Enhanced clinical capabilities |
| **Process**   | System silos, data fragmentation     | End-to-end integrated workflows   | Streamlined operations         |
| **Learning**  | System limitations, skill gaps       | Staff proficiency in 6 months     | Technology-enabled growth      |

## Step 3: Transition State Management

### Phase 1: Regulatory Compliance Foundation (Months 1-6)

- **Problem addressed:** Immediate compliance risks
- **Value delivered:** DOH and PhilHealth compliance
- **Success measure:** Zero compliance violations

### Phase 2: Clinical Integration (Months 7-12)

- **Problem addressed:** Clinical workflow disruption
- **Value delivered:** Integrated EMR with clinical decision support
- **Success measure:** Clinical alerts functional, 50% adoption

### Phase 3: Operational Optimization (Months 13-18)

- **Problem addressed:** Administrative inefficiencies
- **Value delivered:** Full ERP integration, automated workflows
- **Success measure:** 25% reduction in manual processes

**Transition State Validation:**

- Each phase solves meaningful portion of core problem
- Operational stability maintained throughout
- Foundation built for subsequent phases

------

## Step 4: Weekly Focus Maintenance

**Litmus Tests:**

- Are we solving regulatory compliance and operational efficiency, or just implementing new technology?
- Can everyone explain: "We're replacing legacy systems to ensure regulatory compliance and improve patient care"?
- Are current activities advancing compliance and efficiency metrics?

**Decision Filter Example:** *Request: "Add advanced analytics dashboard"*

1. Does this serve regulatory compliance/efficiency? **No**
2. Does this advance success criteria? **No**
3. Does this align with vision? **Partially**
4. Does this maintain transition focus? **No**

**Result:** Reject - not aligned with core problem

------

## Framework Benefits Demonstrated

**Scope Creep Prevention:** Clear problem definition prevents "nice to have" features that don't serve regulatory compliance **Success Criteria Clarity:** Measurable compliance and efficiency metrics prevent abstract success measures **Vision Maintenance:** Single-sentence vision keeps focus on compliance and patient care, not technology features **Transition State Value:** Each phase delivers meaningful compliance and operational improvements
