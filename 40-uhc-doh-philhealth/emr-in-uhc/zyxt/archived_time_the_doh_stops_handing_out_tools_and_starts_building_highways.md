# DOH Carpenter

Let's write an opinion article for posting in Medium or a blog. Target readers are healthcare leaders and industry experts. Here are the points of the article, in no particular order :

- Other industries have shown that foresight in building the infrastructure first benefits the creation of an ecosystem that benefits stakeholders
  - BSP build infrastructure that would allow real-time transfer of money. This allowed the growth of fintech companies, such as Gcash and Maya, and benefitted the unbanked
  - Gov't regulations on telco focused on creating the foundations of an industry that would allow the growth of mobile use and reach far flung areas. It improved communcation and data transfer even to GIDA
- In contrast, DOH is stuck in a different mindset: handing out fragmented, outdated systems that does not provide long-term value and stifles innovation
- DOH is offering iClinicSys and iHOMIS like donations, as free software. These systems were never designed to operate in a seamless, nationally-integrated ecosystem. They served as data entry for submissions of nationally-mandated reports
- The numbers don't lie. The systems have very limited adoption rate--as high as 10% only in some reports. Many LGUs even resort to getting data encoders to reenter data, and resorting to Google Sheets because of system inefficency
- This is where free stifled innovation. Instead of nurturing an environment for varied grass roots solutions, it enforced, encouraged and ingrained the dole out culture, where poor systems are tolerated as long as it is free.
- It is clearly a strategy failure.
- DOH needs to stop acting like carpenters doling out ineffective furnitures. They should start acting like strategic architects and build proper long-term road maps
- We need to start building Health IT highways. DOH shouldn't be building cars. They should be building roads, setting traffic rules, and ensuring everyone drives on the same side of the road. Let the market build the cars.
- There are plenty of health IT highways that come to mind. Some of them, in no particular order of priority:
  - National ePrescription Highway - medication prescriptions from any clinic, public or private, are sent to any pharmacy of choice, for pick-up and recording
  - National Patient Referral Highway - patient navigation and referral system from primary care up to the apex hospitals and back
  - National Immunization registry - going after recording fully immunized children, adult vaccinations and epidemic vaccinations
- These are just sample highway ideas. There are many more that can benefit the nation and the patients
- Recommendations:
  - Become the national planner, not the software developer
  - Set the rules of the road
  - Build the core infrastructure
  - Open the system to competition
  - Own the architecture, not the endpoints
- The DOH's failed strategy has real consequences:

  - Medication errors occur because pharmacists can't access prescription histories.
  - Patients receive duplicate tests because results aren't shared.
  - Children miss vaccinations because records are lost.
  - Emergency patients die because receiving hospitals aren't prepared.
  - Disease outbreaks spread because surveillance data arrives too late.
- This is not about taking shots at the DOH—it's about urging a shift in mindset, one that other sectors have already embraced with measurable success.
- The DOH can build healthcare highways, and every Filipino can benefit from truly connected, coordinated care. But only if they stop being carpenters and start being architects. It's time to stop paving little side streets and start building the highways.
