# Special Health Fund Management Guide

The management of the Special Health Fund (SHF) involves multiple entities and follows specific guidelines, particularly in the context of integrated Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS).

Here's a breakdown of who manages the Special Health Fund and what happens when different local government units (LGUs) progress at varying rates or choose to manage their own health systems:

## Who Manages the Special Health Fund?

The **Provincial Health Board (PHB) and City Health Board (CHB) are fully responsible for the management of the Special Health Fund (SHF)**. They are tasked with ensuring the optimal utilization of the SHF to help achieve desirable health outcomes for the population within their respective territorial jurisdiction. This management must adhere to existing budgeting, accounting, and auditing rules and regulations.

To support the PHB and CHB in their operations, including the management of the SHF, the following structures are put in place:

- A **Management Support Unit (MSU)** is created under the direct supervision of the concerned health board to serve as its administrative secretariat. The MSU provides administrative and technical support, coordinates with P/CWHS stakeholders, and offers financial support functions, such as ensuring timely submission of information to PhilHealth, preparing the health board resolution on the SHF budget, and preparing financial status and physical accomplishment reports. To ensure accountability, existing plantilla personnel from the Provincial/City Government can be designated or appointed as part of the MSU, which should comprise, at a minimum, an Accountant, an Administrative Officer, and a Liaison Officer.
- The **Provincial/City Health Office (P/CHO) acts as the technical secretariat** of the Health Board, working in close coordination with the MSU. The P/CHO is responsible for the technical integration and supervision of the P/CWHS.

### SHF Resource Sources

The SHF pools and manages all resources intended for health services. These resources include:

- Financial grants and subsidies from national government agencies, such as the Department of Health (DOH).
- Income derived from PhilHealth payments. All such income from LGU-owned and managed health offices, facilities, and services accrues to the SHF and is to be allocated by the LGUs exclusively for the improvement of the LGU health system.
- Financial grants and donations from Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Faith-Based Organizations, and Official Development Assistance.
- Concerned LGUs may also opt to transfer their local budget intended for health to the SHF through a mechanism of cooperative undertakings.

### SHF Allocation and Management

The PHB and CHB determine and approve the allocation of the SHF for various purposes, including population-based and individual-based health services, capital investments, health system operating costs, and remuneration or incentives for additional health workers. The allocation of DOH financial grants and PhilHealth income is based on the contractual obligations of the PHB/CHB with these national agencies for population-based and individual-based services, respectively, as well as the Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH) and SHF guidelines.

Planning and budgeting for the SHF are based on the LIPH and corresponding Annual Operational Plans (AOPs), which are facilitated by the P/CHB through the P/CHO with assistance from DOH Centers for Health Development (CHDs). A PHB/CHB Resolution approving the SHF budget must be deliberated, endorsed, and approved by the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and a majority of the board members.

### Transparency and Accountability

For transparency and accountability, a separate SHF book of accounts with complete financial reporting obligations must be created and maintained at the Province, Highly Urbanized City (HUC), and Independent Component City (ICC) levels, along with subsidiary ledgers for each fund source. The PHB/CHB must furnish the DOH and PhilHealth with copies of the LIPH, AOP, and the PHB/CHB Resolution detailing SHF expenditures for monitoring purposes. The DOH and PhilHealth are also mandated to establish and maintain an SHF utilization tracking system for real-time data collection, consolidation, and analysis. Misuse of the SHF for disallowed items can lead to penalties for erring officials.

## What Happens if Some Cities in a Province Progress but Not All?

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act encourages LGUs to integrate their local health systems into P/CWHS, and this integration is monitored through the Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML) framework. The integration is pursued by LGUs that express their commitment.

If **some cities or municipalities within a province commit to and progress in integration while others do not**, the following applies:

- For local health systems that **did not commit to integration**, existing mechanisms for health service delivery and financial management remain in effect. This means that the non-integrating LGUs continue to operate under their previous health governance and financial arrangements.
- The DOH provides technical and financial support specifically to selected LGUs that **commit** to province-wide or city-wide integration. This additional support aims to strengthen health systems management and service delivery within those integrating LGUs.
- The UHC Act envisions a phased integration, starting with managerial integration (first three years) and subsequently financial integration (next three years). The full integration of all local health systems as prescribed by Section 19 of the UHC Act is contingent upon a positive recommendation from an independent study commissioned by the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee on UHC and the Secretary of Health, followed by an Executive Order from the President. This staggered approach allows for flexible progress among LGUs.

## What Happens to Big Cities Who Would Rather Manage Themselves Rather Than Have the Provincial Government Involved?

The UHC Act specifically differentiates between **Highly Urbanized Cities (HUCs)** and **Independent Component Cities (ICCs)** from component cities. HUCs and ICCs are designated as forming their own **City-wide Health Systems (CWHS)**, distinct from province-wide health systems which are composed of municipalities and component cities.

These big cities are empowered to manage their own health systems independently:

- **HUCs and ICCs endeavor to integrate their own health offices, health centers or stations, hospitals, and other city-managed health facilities to constitute their respective city-wide health systems**. These city-wide health systems are linked to at least one apex or end-referral hospital.
- The **City Health Board (CHB)** in HUCs and ICCs is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the integration and delivery of health services within their CWHS, and for **managing the Special Health Fund for their city**. They also exercise administrative and technical supervision over health facilities and human resources within their territorial jurisdiction.
- The **City Health Office (CHO)**, headed by a City Health Officer, is responsible for health service delivery and health systems management for the entire city-wide health system.

This framework allows HUCs and ICCs to maintain autonomy in their local health governance, operating their CWHS in parallel to provincial health systems, rather than being under the direct involvement or management of the provincial government.

## Summary Analogy

Think of the Special Health Fund as a **community health trust**. The **Provincial and City Health Boards act as the trustees**, bearing the ultimate responsibility for overseeing and allocating these pooled funds to meet their community's health needs, from essential services to infrastructure improvements. They are assisted by dedicated **support teams (MSU and P/CHO)** who serve as the trust's administrators and technical advisors, handling the detailed financial operations and strategic health planning.

For **smaller towns (component cities)**, they can opt to join a larger, **provincial health cooperative**, pooling their resources and decision-making under the provincial board's stewardship, or they can continue to manage their own health funds independently if they don't integrate.

Meanwhile, **major urban centers (Highly Urbanized and Independent Component Cities)** function as **independent health jurisdictions**, having their own dedicated city health boards that manage their distinct health trusts, ensuring tailored healthcare solutions without direct provincial oversight.
