## Root Cause Analysis

### The 5 Whys Technique

1. **Why does this problem occur?**
2. **Why does that cause happen?**
3. **Why does that underlying cause exist?**
4. **Why is that systemic issue present?**
5. **Why is that fundamental problem there?**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Example: Delayed Imaging Results

1. Reports not communicated quickly
2. Radiologist not immediately available
3. One radiologist covers multiple hospitals
4. Limited radiologist availability in region
5. Shortage of specialists in provincial areas
