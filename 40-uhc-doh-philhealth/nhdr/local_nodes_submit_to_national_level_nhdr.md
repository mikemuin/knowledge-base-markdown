# Local Nodes Submit to National Level NHDR

Yes, it is **correct to assume** that, based on the implementation intent of the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, **local nodes, such as clinics or health centers, are required to submit health and health-related data directly or indirectly to the national level NHDR**.

The structure mandates that data originating at the local level must ultimately be processed and submitted to the centralized repository, making the local nodes the foundational source of the data.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the explicit mechanisms and requirements that mandate this submission:

### 1. Mandatory Data Submission by All Health-Related Entities

The UHC Act explicitly makes data submission to the NHDR a mandatory requirement for operational entities, which includes local clinics and health centers.

- **Universal Mandate:** **All public and private, national and local health-related entities shall be required to submit health and health-related data to PhilHealth** (which is mandated to establish and maintain the NHDR).
- **Definition of Health-Related Entities:** "Health-related entities" explicitly include **health care facilities**. Primary care facilities (PCFs), such as rural health units (RHUs) and health centers, are the local nodes providing initial care.
- **Type of Data:** The data submitted includes, but is not limited to, **administrative, public health, medical, pharmaceutical, and health financing data**. This covers electronic health records (EHRs), prescription logs, and other administrative data generated at the local facility level.
- **Primary Data Source:** Health and health-related data must come from the **primary data source or as close as possible to the point of creation**. For patient care records, this "point of creation" is the local clinic or health center.

### 2. The Integrated Health Information System (iHIS) as the Submission Mechanism

The local health facilities use an Integrated Health Information System (iHIS) that is specifically designed to feed data up to the national level.

- **iHIS Requirement:** All health service providers and insurers (including clinics and health centers) are required to **maintain a health information system** (iHIS) that includes electronic health records and other modules.
- **Electronic Uploading:** This data **shall be electronically uploaded on a regular basis through interoperable systems** consistent with standards set by the Department of Health (DOH) and PhilHealth.
- **iHIS Functionality:** The minimum general functionalities of an integrated HIS explicitly include the capacity to **generate, process, and submit health and health-related data and reports at the local (i.e., within Province-wide/City-wide Health Systems [P/CWHS]) and national levels (i.e., to PhilHealth and/or DOH)**.
- **Specific EMR Example (iClinicSys):** Systems like the Integrated Clinic Information System (**iClinicSys**), which is the DOH's homegrown EMR for clinics/RHUs, are explicitly intended to collect health indicators. These EMRs must be capable of submitting reports to DOH and PhilHealth. As of June 2024, EMR systems were adopted by **94.25% (2,441 of 2,590) of rural health units**.
- **Compliance is Mandatory:** The implementation and maintenance of an integrated HIS is a requirement for **DOH licensing and PhilHealth accreditation**.

### 3. Submission Model: Centralized or Decentralized

The NHDR framework allows for two models of data submission, both requiring data from the local level to reach the national repository:

- **Centralized Dataset Submission Model:** This enables health care providers, insurers, and health-related entities to **submit health and health-related data directly to the NHDR**.
- **Decentralized Dataset Submission Model:** This model accounts for data that must undergo processing at the national or **local government units** (LGUs) before submission to the NHDR. Since LGUs manage RHUs and health centers, data collected locally might first be processed at the municipal or provincial health office level before being consolidated and submitted nationally. Health care providers and entities are mandated to submit data to **PhilHealth through the NHDR, or DOH** using their iHIS, or any equivalent mechanism.

### 4. Technical Enforcement through SCIV

To ensure that the data submitted by local facilities conforms to the national repository's needs, a validation process is mandated:

- **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV):** All local HIS/EMRs implemented by health care providers (including clinics and health centers) must undergo and pass SCIV to verify **conformance with national health data standards for interoperability**. This ensures that the decentralized local systems can seamlessly communicate and exchange data with the centralized NHDR.
- **PHIE Integration:** Achieving full functionality (Level 3) means the local iHIS must **integrate with the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE)**, which is supported by the NHDR and is critical for coordinating referrals within the Health Care Provider Network (HCPN).
