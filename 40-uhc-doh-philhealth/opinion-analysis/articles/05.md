## The Missing Links: The Five Registries That Make or Break NHDR

Every national health information system rests on a simple foundation — *knowing who, where, what, and how*. Who the patient is, where the encounter happened, what was done, and how it was recorded.

Without those anchors, no amount of technology or funding will make health data interoperable. That’s why every functioning national health data exchange — from Rwanda to Singapore — started with a set of **foundational registries**.

The Philippines tried to build the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) without them. That’s like trying to build a hospital without medical records, or a city without street names.

These registries — **Patient, Facility, Provider, Terminology, and Product** — are the missing links that make or break the NHDR.

------

### Why Registries Matter

A registry is not a database. It’s an **authoritative source of truth** for a specific domain.

- The **Patient Registry** ensures every person’s health record can be accurately linked across systems.
- The **Facility Registry** ensures data from every hospital or clinic is properly identified.
- The **Provider Registry** ensures each consultation, order, or claim can be traced to a licensed professional.
- The **Terminology Registry** ensures that everyone uses the same codes for diseases, tests, and procedures.
- The **Product Registry** ensures that medicines and devices are consistently referenced across the system.

Without these, no health information exchange can function — because every record becomes ambiguous. The same patient can appear as ten different entries. A facility’s data can’t be validated. Claims can’t be cross-referenced with clinical records. Disease counts can’t be trusted.

Registries are the scaffolding that holds the health data ecosystem together.

------

### 1. The Patient Registry (Master Patient Index)

The most important — and most politically sensitive — registry is the **Master Patient Index (MPI)**. It’s what allows a patient’s records to be linked across multiple facilities while preserving privacy and consent.

In theory, the Philippines already has an identifier: the **PhilHealth ID**. But in practice, millions of citizens either don’t have one, or use different identifiers across systems — PhilHealth ID, hospital number, barangay ID, or national ID (PhilSys).

The NHDR cannot unify health records until there is one **authoritative patient identity framework**. That doesn’t mean a single number — it means a **linkage system** that can resolve multiple identifiers to one patient record using probabilistic matching.

This registry doesn’t have to be managed by PhilHealth alone. It should be **jointly governed by DOH, PhilHealth, and PSA (PhilSys)**, under strict privacy rules defined by the National Privacy Commission (NPC).

Once established, it enables every other layer — referrals, claims, analytics, and longitudinal health tracking.

------

### 2. The Facility Registry

The **National Health Facility Registry (NHFR)** exists — but it’s incomplete, inconsistently updated, and not fully integrated into other systems.

A functional Facility Registry should do more than list facility names. It should provide a standardized record for each health establishment — with codes, ownership type, location (using PSGC codes), and service capabilities.

Every dataset — from PhilHealth claims to disease surveillance — must reference this registry. Without it, you can’t trace where care was provided or verify data consistency.

Governance should be clear: **DOH as the authoritative source**, with **regional and LGU-level stewards** responsible for maintaining accuracy. Synchronization with the NHDR should happen automatically through APIs, not manual uploads.

------

### 3. The Provider Registry

The **Provider Registry** links actions to people — ensuring that every diagnosis, procedure, or prescription can be traced to a licensed healthcare professional.

This registry should integrate data from the **Professional Regulation Commission (PRC)**, **DOH licensing**, and **PhilHealth accreditation** databases. It would assign a persistent provider ID, enabling national verification without storing sensitive information.

Beyond compliance, this registry also supports workforce analytics — identifying gaps in doctor-to-population ratios, specialist distribution, and facility staffing patterns.

Governance: **DOH and PRC as joint custodians**, with periodic synchronization to ensure current licensing status.

------

### 4. The Terminology Registry

The Terminology Registry is the **language layer** of interoperability. Without it, every system speaks its own dialect.

It maps codes and classifications — ICD-10 for diseases, SNOMED CT for clinical terms, LOINC for lab tests, ATC for medicines, CPT or ICD-10-PCS for procedures. It also includes national value sets — like PhilHealth package codes and DOH program identifiers.

The NHDR must operate with a **central terminology service** (e.g., Snowstorm, CSIRO’s Shrimp, or Apelon DTS) that manages version control and validation.

Governance: **DOH KMITS and PhilHealth IMS**, supported by a national Terminology Technical Committee that approves mappings and updates.

This registry ensures that “dengue fever” in one EMR means the same thing as “Dengue hemorrhagic fever (A91)” in another. It’s the difference between aggregated analytics and data chaos.

------

### 5. The Product Registry

Every prescription, claim, or inventory entry depends on consistent identification of health commodities — medicines, vaccines, supplies, and devices.
Right now, product identification varies across agencies: FDA maintains its own lists, DOH uses internal codes, and PhilHealth references different package definitions.

The **Product Registry** should consolidate these sources. Each item — from paracetamol tablets to diagnostic kits — should have a unique, standardized identifier linked to its registration, manufacturer, and category.

Governance: **FDA as the authoritative source**, with linkages to DOH procurement systems and PhilHealth claims databases.

This registry enables safe tracking of medicines, supports pharmacovigilance, and simplifies logistics and reimbursement.

------

### Why the Absence of Registries Is Breaking the System

The Philippines’ current health data environment looks connected on paper but isn’t in practice because every dataset lives in a different identity universe.

- The same hospital can appear under three names and two codes.
- The same doctor can have multiple identifiers across PhilHealth and DOH.
- The same patient can show up five times under different IDs.
- The same lab result can’t be compared between systems because of mismatched test codes.

This is why data aggregation and analytics in the health sector remain unreliable. The absence of registries is not just a technical flaw — it’s the root cause of every failed integration attempt.

------

### How to Build Them — Practically

1. **Start with what exists.**
Don’t wait for perfect registries. Use the current NHFR, PRC, and PhilHealth datasets as starting points and progressively clean and unify them.
2. **Assign custodianship, not ownership.**
Each registry must have an official custodian responsible for data quality and updates — but all must synchronize through the NHDR interoperability layer.
3. **Expose APIs.**
Every registry should have secure, standards-based APIs for lookup, validation, and synchronization. Facilities shouldn’t have to upload spreadsheets to verify facility codes or provider IDs.
4. **Version and audit everything.**
Registries evolve. Every update should be versioned and logged. Nothing breaks interoperability faster than silent code changes.
5. **Make them open (within reason).**
Public access to non-sensitive registry metadata encourages transparency, academic use, and vendor alignment.

------

### The Path Forward

Before the Philippines builds another reporting system, it needs to finish the registries.
Before it defines another interoperability standard, it must define identifiers.
Before it talks about “big data,” it must first master *small, correct data*.

The NHDR will never work until these five registries exist, are governed, and are synchronized. Once they do, the rest of the architecture — interoperability, analytics, FHIR, dashboards — becomes achievable.

Without them, everything remains disconnected paperwork wearing digital clothes.

------

### The Bottom Line

The five foundational registries are not technical luxuries. They are the **spine of the health data ecosystem**.
Every health transaction depends on them. Every policy relies on them. Every attempt at integration will fail without them.

The Philippines doesn’t need another data repository yet. It needs these five registries — clean, connected, and governed.

Only then can the NHDR stand.
