# HCPNs should be empowered with HIEs

The sources confirm that while Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs) are primarily organizational and service delivery structures, their operational mandate under Universal Health Care (UHC) explicitly requires the establishment and functionality of key technical systems that essentially function as localized Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) for the network.

It is **explicit** that HCPNs must implement the necessary technical infrastructure for seamless information exchange, linking them directly to the national digital health ecosystem.

Here is a detailed analysis focusing on the operationalization of UHC concepts through the technology empowering HCPNs:

### 1. HCPN Mandates Require HIE-Like Technology

The UHC Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) stipulate specific, technology-intensive requirements for HCPNs, ensuring the network is technologically functional:

- **Interoperable Patient Records Management System:** All contracted HCPNs must have a **patient records management system, including electronic health records**, that **ensures records are accessible by all facilities or providers within the health care provider networks or among other facilities as necessary**. Furthermore, HCPNs must establish a patient record management system with an **interoperable electronic medical record (EMR) in all member health facilities capable of real-time information-sharing**. This system must include patient records, diagnostics, and treatment history. The requirement for shared, accessible, and real-time electronic records fundamentally demands HIE functionality within the network.
- **Harmonized Information and Communication Technology (ICT):** HCPNs are required to institute **harmonized information and communication technology** (ICT) as one of the systems within the network.
- **Assurance of Digital Access:** Contracted HCPNs must assure member access to all levels of the network, including the **use of digital technologies for health**. This capability supports the provision of individual-based health services remotely through digital technologies for health.
- **PCPN Foundation:** The Primary Care Provider Network (PCPN), which is the foundation of the HCPN, is specifically required to **enable patient records to be accessible throughout the health system**.

### 2. Operationalizing the ICT-Enabled Referral System

A major operational objective of UHC is integrated and coordinated care, which is impossible without real-time data exchange. The HCPN's required functionalities directly mandate HIE mechanisms:

- **Functional Referral System:** The integrated health information system (iHIS) must operationalize an **ICT-enabled, integrated, and functional referral system within the P/CWHS**. This means the system must link the members of the PCPN to secondary and tertiary care providers within and across P/CWHS.
- **Coordination Capacity:** This ICT-enabled referral system must be **evidenced by capacity to coordinate referrals** from: (a) PCPN to referral facilities, (b) referral facilities to apex hospital(s), and (c) referral facilities or apex hospital(s) back to the PCPN.
- **Patient Navigation:** HCPNs are mandated to establish a **patient navigation and coordination system**. The PCPN acts as the **navigator and coordinator** of health care within the network. Technology, such as the proposed **Teletriage** system, is being developed to manage case tickets for hospital referrals, provide teleconsultation, and integrate with **Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems**.

### 3. Alignment with the National Interoperability Framework

The HCPNs' internal systems are explicitly designed to conform to the national standards necessary to participate in the broader, national-level exchange (NHDR/PHIE), ensuring that local *networks of care* become *networks of technology*:

- **iHIS Implementation:** All health care providers and insurers, which constitute the HCPNs, are required to implement and maintain an **integrated Health Information System (iHIS)**. This iHIS must include core modules like **electronic health/medical records**, **referral system management**, and **PhilHealth electronic claims processing and provider payment**.
- **Standards Conformance and Validation (SCIV):** To ensure these local systems function as a coherent network, all health information systems and other eHealth solutions implemented by health care providers (HCPN members) must undergo and pass **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)**. This validation verifies conformance with **national health data standards for interoperability**.
- **Integration with PHIE:** The ultimate stage of iHIS implementation (Stage 3) requires the **iHIS to integrate with the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE)**. The PHIE is described as the **"heart of a person-centric EA"** and an **integral component of the health care delivery system to support UHC**. The NHDR is positioned as an enabler to support the implementation of the PHIE.

In conclusion, while the term "HIE" might be reserved for the national-level component (**PHIE**) and the repository (**NHDR**), the mandatory requirements placed on HCPNs for an **interoperable patient records management system** and a **functional, ICT-enabled referral system** capable of **real-time information sharing** means that the component technology of the HCPN is designed to operate as a local, practical Health Information Exchange feeding into the larger national system. The explicit requirement for **SCIV compliance** ensures that this conceptual network is indeed operationalized through **real HIE technology** that adheres to national data standards.
