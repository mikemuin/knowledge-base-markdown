The Department of Health (DOH) plays a crucial role in road safety, primarily by integrating it into its broader health promotion, disease prevention, and emergency response mandates under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act [1, 2].

Here are the specific roles of the DOH in road safety:

1.  **Strategic Alignment and Policy Stewardship**:
    *   The DOH, as the overall steward for healthcare, strengthens national efforts in providing a comprehensive and coordinated approach to health development, with an emphasis on **scaling up health promotion and preventive care** [2].
    *   Road safety is explicitly addressed as part of **"Violence and Injury Prevention,"** which is one of the seven priority areas for action under the DOH's **Health Promotion Framework Strategy (HPFS)** [3-6].
    *   The HPFS serves as the national roadmap for health promotion, and its programs aim to increase health literacy and address social determinants of health [7, 8].
    *   "Risky driving" is identified as a health risk behavior that the DOH's health promotion strategies aim to mitigate [9].
    *   The DOH advocates for and coordinates efforts to foster **"Infrastructure and public spaces that promote mobility and safe road use"**, working with other agencies like the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) [10]. This is part of creating health-enabling environments [11].

2.  **Target Setting and Monitoring**:
    *   The DOH has established clear targets for reducing the burden of road traffic injuries. The **death rate due to road traffic injuries** is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI 3.4) [12].
    *   The baseline death rate in 2020 was **8.0 per 100,000 population** [12].
    *   The **2028 target** is to reduce this rate to **4.80 per 100,000 population** [12].
    *   The long-term **2030 target** is a further reduction to **4.0 per 100,000 population**, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [11].
    *   Monitoring of these targets relies on data from Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) [12].

3.  **Emergency Preparedness and Response (Post-Crash Care)**:
    *   The DOH's **Health Emergency Management Bureau (HEMB)** leads the institutionalization of **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in Health (DRRM-H)** systems within Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS) [13-17].
    *   This system is a minimum component of population-based health services, aiming to ensure **timely, effective, and efficient preparedness and response to public health emergencies and disasters** [16]. This directly relates to the "survival after a crash" aspect of road safety.
    *   HEMB provides technical assistance for developing DRRM-H plans, protocols, guidelines, and standards for health emergency management, and for implementing population-based health services in emergency situations [13, 15, 17].
    *   This includes mobilizing resources such as essential commodities, equipment, and supplies during disasters, and providing medical and public health services as part of essential health service packages in emergencies [13, 15, 18]. The DOH also plays a critical role in preparing for and responding to public health emergencies and ensuring the health system can handle crises [19].

In essence, the DOH addresses road safety through **preventive measures** focusing on health promotion and behavior change (e.g., addressing risky driving and promoting safe road infrastructure) and **response measures** through its DRRM-H initiatives to manage the health consequences of road traffic crashes.
