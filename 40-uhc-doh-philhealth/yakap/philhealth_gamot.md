# PhilHealth GAMOT

PhilHealth GAMOT (Guaranteed and Accessible Medications for Outpatient Treatment) is a significant new outpatient drug benefit package implemented by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). It aims to reduce the financial burden of pharmaceutical expenses on Filipino families by covering outpatient medications and expanding access points for these services.

Here's an overview of PhilHealth GAMOT and its related aspects:

- **What is PhilHealth GAMOT?**
  - **Purpose:** PhilHealth GAMOT is designed to implement the outpatient drug benefit mandated by the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, expanding access to medications and functioning as PhilHealth’s pharmaceutical service delivery arm for outpatient benefits.
  - **Coverage:** It covers **select medications** used in the outpatient management of various health conditions, enumerated in the "GAMOT List," which is referenced from the latest edition of the Philippine National Formulary (PNF). Each medication corresponds to a **fixed fee schedule**.
  - **Exclusions:** It does **not cover** medications intended for consumption during inpatient confinement or outpatient emergency care, branded medications priced above the fixed fee (unless the facility dispenses them at the fixed fee), medications already covered by other outpatient benefits, or PNF medications not explicitly included in the GAMOT List.
  - **Benefit Limit:** Beneficiaries have an **Annual Benefit Limit (ABL) of Twenty Thousand Pesos (PHP 20,000.00)**. Patients will not incur out-of-pocket (OOP) payments until this ABL is fully consumed, and the ABL resets every calendar year on January 1st.
  - **Eligibility:** All Filipino citizens are eligible to avail of PhilHealth GAMOT by virtue of the UHC Act, along with foreign nationals who have qualifying contributions and their qualified dependents. A PhilHealth Identification Number (PIN) is essential for membership verification, as well as for recording and tracking benefit consumption. If not yet registered, Filipinos can register at any Local Health Insurance Office (LHIO) or PhilHealth Express outlet nationwide.
- **Impact on Konsulta:**
  - **Integration:** PhilHealth GAMOT is intended to be a **component of comprehensive outpatient care coverage**, which includes the PhilHealth Konsulta (Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama) benefit package.
  - **Medication Coverage Shift:** The 21 medications previously covered under the enhanced PhilHealth YAKAP (formerly Konsulta) are **temporarily disabled** in the GAMOT App for Calendar Year 2025 or until further notice. These 21 medications, including their dispensing and payments, are **to be subsumed under PhilHealth GAMOT**. The Konsulta package itself covers a list of 21 select drugs and medicines, including common antimicrobials, anti-asthma drugs, antipyretics, anti-diabetics, anti-dyslipidemia, anti-hypertensives, and anti-thrombotics, as well as oral rehydration salts.
  - **Registration for Konsulta:** To avail of Konsulta benefits, Filipinos must register with a PhilHealth-accredited Konsulta Package Provider (KPP), which helps ensure continuous primary care and referrals. Registration can be done through the PhilHealth Member Portal, PhilHealth offices (LHIOs, PCARES, Action Center Hotline), or third-party assisted registration by KPPs, LGUs, or other authorized agencies.
- **Implications for Healthcare Provider Networks (HCPNs):**
  - PhilHealth has issued guidelines for contracting Healthcare Provider Networks (HCPNs). HCPNs are groups of healthcare providers integrated to deliver comprehensive, coordinated care from primary to tertiary levels.
  - GAMOT implementation was initially enabled through contracted HCPNs. While PhilHealth Circular 2025-0013 allows for the **direct engagement of drug dispensing facilities** nationwide, GAMOT remains a component of broader outpatient care coverage that HCPNs are designed to provide.
  - HCPNs are responsible for managing payment for various benefits, including Konsulta+SDG, All Case Rates-based Global Budget (ACR-GB), and the Outpatient Drug Benefit (ODB), which is PhilHealth GAMOT.
  - Accreditation of GAMOT facilities for HCPN demonstration sites can be done simultaneously with the HCPN application.
- **Implications for Implementers (Drug Dispensing Facilities and Physicians):**
  - Drug Dispensing Facilities (GAMOT Facilities):
    - Must be **FDA and/or DOH-licensed drug retailers** (e.g., retail drug stores, hospital pharmacies, primary care facilities with dispensing capacity) and obtain PhilHealth accreditation, which is typically valid for up to three years. No pre-accreditation survey is required.
    - Are required to **install PhilHealth signage** and **ensure the constant availability** of all committed medications on the GAMOT List, with a posted list of available medicines.
    - They must serve all PhilHealth beneficiaries; refusal to serve can lead to investigation.
    - Dispensing requires verification of the transaction through a government-issued ID and the prescription, or a Unique Prescription Security Code (UPSC) for remote consultations. Authorized representatives can also claim medications with a letter and valid IDs.
    - Pharmacists can verify prescription authenticity with the physician and withhold inappropriate medications.
    - There are **claiming periods**: anti-infectious medications within 2 days, other medications within 2 weeks. Prescriptions in the GAMOT App are valid for 90 days from the date of issue.
    - Maintenance medications can be dispensed monthly (maximum one month's supply at a time), with succeeding monthly provisions available two weeks after the previous dispensing. Anti-infectious medications must always be dispensed in full.
  - Authorized Physicians:
    - Must be **accredited by PhilHealth** and have a GAMOT Application account.
    - They are responsible for confirming the beneficiary's identity (using PIN or valid ID), accurately encoding diagnoses (ICD-10 standard), and prescribing medications through the **GAMOT App**, which generates a Unique Prescription Security Code (UPSC) for each prescription.
    - Physicians must provide a copy of the prescription to the beneficiary.
    - Maximum prescription quantities apply: 3 months for maintenance medications and 1 week for NSAIDs.
    - They must check for existing active prescriptions before issuing new ones to avoid duplication or revise existing ones if dosage/preparation needs change.
    - Physicians are expected to adhere to the highest standards of medical care; unethical or fraudulent activities will result in sanctions.
- **Payment and Financial Sustainability:**
  - **Reimbursement:** GAMOT facilities are reimbursed by PhilHealth based on the fixed fee schedule. Reimbursements are processed through the Auto-Credit Payment Scheme (ACPS).
  - **Claims Process:** Each duly signed GAMOT Availment Slip (GAS) is automatically filed as a reimbursement claim through the GAMOT App. Claims are subject to billing audits and PhilHealth's payment recovery policy.
  - **Financial Sustainability Challenges:** The immediate eligibility policy (delinking entitlement from premium payment) creates complexities for PhilHealth's financial sustainability, as it may reduce incentives for direct contributors (like self-paying members) to continue paying premiums. Rigid government budgeting processes also limit PhilHealth's ability to respond to increases in indirect membership. The controversial transfer of PhilHealth's accumulated reserves to the national treasury and the approval of a zero government subsidy in the 2025 national budget further highlight the vulnerability of PhilHealth's funding model to political and budgetary decisions.
  - **Out-of-pocket Payments:** Despite PhilHealth coverage, out-of-pocket payments remain a significant burden, especially in private facilities, indicating that PhilHealth's standardized benefit payments may be insufficient to provide meaningful financial protection. This suggests a need to enhance benefits and strategic purchasing capacity to increase the perceived value of PhilHealth membership.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
  - PhilHealth will conduct monitoring activities at least once a year to evaluate GAMOT's operationalization, including medicine availability and cost-sharing implementation.
  - Grievance reports from beneficiaries, authorized physicians, and GAMOT facilities will be continuously monitored and investigated.
  - Performance reports generated from the GAMOT App will be used for evaluation.
- **System Readiness and Challenges:**
  - While the UHC Law removed prior registration as a legal precondition for benefits, having a PIN remains operationally critical for providers to file claims and receive reimbursements.
  - Current IT infrastructure struggles with seamless, real-time verification and registration, especially after-hours or on weekends, leading to delays in discharge or out-of-pocket payments.
  - Documentation requirements, data quality issues, and poor interoperability with national databases also hinder effective implementation.
  - PhilHealth's multi-tiered organizational structure, including LHIOs, PhilHealth Express, Service Desks, and Malasakit Centers, provides a broad operational base, but disparities in infrastructure, staffing, and digital connectivity still pose challenges.
