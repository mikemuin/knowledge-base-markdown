# Critique of DOH Software

This is a comprehensive critique of your position, drawing specifically on the principles, mandates, and findings related to the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act's Health Information System (HIS) implementation, particularly the results of the UHC-IS study.

Your argument touches upon core philosophical and operational challenges regarding the role of government in digital health, challenges that are well-documented in the policy materials provided.

## Critique of the Position

Your position—that free government software stifles competition, fails as an operational tool, and exceeds the government's proper role—is supported by several key findings from the UHC implementation assessment, even though government mandates legally authorize the current approach.

### 1. Re: Alignment with UHC Initiatives and the Mandate for Free Software

The premise that iClinicSys and iHOMIS, as free software, do not align with UHC initiatives is directly countered by the foundational legal mandates of the program, but the software's *effectiveness* in achieving alignment is questioned by implementation reports.

#### Support for Government's Role (UHC Mandate)

The DOH is **legally mandated** to provide this software at no cost.

- The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act requires all health service providers and insurers to maintain an integrated Health Information System (HIS), including Electronic Health Records (EMRs).
- The DOH and PhilHealth are explicitly tasked to **develop and finance** information systems, **which may be availed at no cost by health care providers and insurers**.
- This provision addresses the financial reality that many entities, particularly local government units (LGUs) and smaller facilities, lack the means or capacity to develop or procure commercial systems. When facilities choose to develop or outsource their own integrated HIS, they are required to **shoulder all related costs using their own administrative funds**.

Therefore, the provision of free software is an **intentional strategy** within the UHC framework to enable access and system implementation, especially for resource-constrained public providers.

### 2. Re: Stifling Competition for the Right Operational EMR

Your concern that free government software stifles proper competition is validated by the implementation context, although the UHC framework explicitly allows for competition guided by conformance to national standards.

#### Private Sector Choice and Competition

UHC policies do **not mandate the exclusive use** of DOH-developed software. LGUs and health facilities **retain the right to select their preferred EMR/EHR provider** or develop their own based on specific needs. However, to be compliant, any non-DOH system must undergo and pass the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)**.

The UHC-IS study findings illustrate this tension:

- Some LGUs use privately-developed EMRs (such as CHITS, Shine, or Drainwiz) because they provide satisfactory performance for their needs, despite the availability of free government options. For instance, one private hospital respondent was **satisfied with their private system (Drainwiz)** and noted that when health institutions are satisfied with third-party systems, it is difficult to mandate the usage of a single government-owned HIS.
- However, the presence of a free option arguably sets a ceiling on the price and complexity that the private sector can offer to public facilities, which protects LGUs with limited budgets.

### 3. Re: Functionality (Data Gathering vs. Operational Metrics/Standards)

Your critique that iClinicSys is perceived primarily as "data gathering and reporting software" rather than a true operational EMR is strongly supported by the UHC-IS assessment.

#### Perceived Functionality Gap (UHC-IS Findings)

Stakeholders, including healthcare workers and regional staff, expressed frustration that the existing systems prioritize reporting requirements over frontline operational needs, leading to inefficiency:

- Interviewees noted that DOH EMRs were designed for the **statistician’s requirement at the national level**, not necessarily for the end-user (the health provider/clinician).
- One respondent was **"very frustrated"** in the implementation of iClinicSys, noting that it had **"no benefit at the regional operations"** and was only seen as an **"added burden"** for users as an additional layer of work.
- The persistence of **multiple, non-interoperable systems**—such as DOH's iClinicSys for FHSIS, PhilHealth's eKonsulta for claims, and local private EMRs—forces healthcare workers into the **burden of double or triple encoding** the same patient information, hindering seamless care delivery. The DOH Epidemiology Bureau confirmed that FHSIS reports are currently handled by both iClinicSys and a **Google Forms aggregate collection system**.
- This operational deficiency is reflected in the utilization rates: in Parañaque, patient registrations through iClinicSys did not even reach 1% of the population, suggesting high underutilization.

#### Necessity of Interoperability Standards (Your Suggested Solution)

Your assertion that **standards for interoperability and operational metrics** are the priority is fully aligned with the core policy direction of the UHC Act and the recommendations of the UHC-IS study.

- The UHC Act mandates the shift toward an **Integrated Health Information System (iHIS)** to reduce overlaps and ensure timely, quality data.
- Policy is focused on establishing and enforcing **National Health Data Standards for Interoperability**.
- The government has instituted the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** process, led by the DOH, PhilHealth, and DICT, to ensure that all HIS/EMR systems (whether government-provided or private) comply with these standards.
- The entire system is meant to converge into the **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)**, which will serve as the single point of submission and authoritative source of health data to enable evidence-informed policy and planning.
- The currently pervasive use of APIs by PhilHealth for claims is criticized because these APIs are **not compliant with the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** global standards, which is necessary for true interoperability.

### 4. Re: Government’s Role in Software Development and Support

Your strongest point, supported by internal government recommendations, is the critique of the **government's capability** to function effectively as a dedicated software developer and supporter.

#### Evidence of Government Limitations (UHC-IS Findings & Enterprise Architecture Review)

1. **Lack of Software Quality Assurance:** The government's own Enterprise Architecture review noted a weak market regulation of eHealth products. More critically, it found that DOH itself **does not presently employ ISO-13485 conformant practices** regarding eHealth software development (iClinicSys or iHOMIS), despite these systems potentially acting as a medical device (Software as a Medical Device, or SAMD), which presents a patient safety risk.
2. **System Usability and Acceptance Issues:** The need to fast-track systems often resulted in usability issues that deterred full utilization. Project instability due to changes in political leadership also plagues key initiatives: one bureau noted that when "the management changes, the project is left in the air".
3. **Recommendations to Outsource:** Addressing these persistent challenges—usability, acceptance, and support—the UHC-IS study explicitly recommends that the DOH should **fast-track the transition to a managed service model for ubiquitous EMRs such as iClinicSys and iHOMIS**. This recommendation suggests that outsourcing the development and daily support/enhancement of these systems to dedicated service providers might be a more effective path than in-house government management to improve functionality and end-user acceptance.

## Conclusion: Synthesis and Stance

Based on the sources, the appropriate stance is one of **nuanced validation**:

1. **Justification for Free Software (The "Why"):** The government is **legally mandated** to develop and provide free EMR software (iClinicSys, iHOMIS) to ensure all facilities, especially resource-poor LGUs, can comply with the UHC mandate and achieve a baseline of digital health adoption. This necessity is directly linked to the UHC goal of equitable access.
2. **Critique of Free Software Functionality (The "How"):** Your critique that this free software often acts as merely data-gathering tool, leading to fragmented systems and double entry, is **accurate based on current implementation reports and user feedback**. This indicates a failure in execution, where the systems prioritized national reporting statistics over operational clinical workflow (an essential feature of a true operational EMR).
3. **The True Priority:** You are **correct** in highlighting that the core UHC objective is **enforcing standards for interoperability (SCIV, FHIR, NHDR)**. This is the mechanism designed to ensure that *any* chosen EMR (public or private) can function as a true operational tool within the integrated health system.
4. **Government Role Moving Forward:** The UHC-IS findings suggest that the government's role should strategically **shift away from being the sole, in-house developer and maintainer** of end-user clinical software (iClinicSys/iHOMIS) toward becoming the **enforcer of digital standards and the provider of foundational registries** (like the Client Registry, Health Facility Registry, and Terminology Services), potentially through moving DOH software to a managed service model.
