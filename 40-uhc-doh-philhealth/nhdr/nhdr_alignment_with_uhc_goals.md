# NHDR Alignment with UHC Goals

The implementation of the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) is fundamentally aligned with the goals of Universal Health Care (UHC) because it serves as the crucial informational backbone mandated by the UHC Act. The NHDR transforms fragmented data collection into a unified, evidence-based system essential for achieving UHC objectives such as better health outcomes, improved health financing, and a more responsive health system.

The NHDR's implementation aligns with UHC goals across several key tracks and objectives mandated by the law:

### 1. Strengthening the Health Information System (UHC Building Block)

The NHDR is the mechanism designed to address the fragmented health information system (HIS) in the country, which is a major pillar of UHC implementation.

- **Single Source of Truth:** The NHDR is established as the **single point of submission and authoritative repository** of health and health-related data (including administrative, public health, medical, pharmaceutical, and health financing data). PhilHealth is mandated to establish and maintain the NHDR.
- **Interoperability and Standardization:** The UHC Act mandates health service providers and insurers to maintain interoperable HIS. The NHDR aligns with this by requiring all health-related entities to comply with **national health data standards for interoperability**.
- **Integrated HIS (iHIS):** All health care providers and insurers are required to implement and maintain an integrated HIS (iHIS) that conforms to standards set by the Department of Health (DOH) and PhilHealth. This iHIS, which covers systems like electronic medical records (EMRs) and supply chain management, is critical for compliance, as health data must be electronically uploaded to the NHDR through interoperable systems.
- **Validation for Compliance:** The implementation process requires all health information systems to undergo and pass the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** to verify conformance with national health data standards and rules for processing and submission to the NHDR. Implementation of the integrated HIS and its maintenance forms part of DOH licensing and PhilHealth accreditation requirements.

### 2. Enabling Evidence-Informed Policy and Planning

A core objective of UHC governance is enabling the generation of evidence-informed policies. The NHDR directly supports this by providing the necessary data foundation:

- **Policy and Decision-Making Support:** The NHDR enables the integration, processing, and analysis of all health and health-related data to provide insights that support operational, tactical, and strategic planning for UHC.
- **Measuring Outcomes and Performance:** The NHDR improves the determination of whether health action plans are delivering expected results. It supports existing UHC monitoring tools such as the **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** and the **LGU Health Scorecard**, which track the progress of integration and LGU performance toward UHC goals.
- **Alignment with National Strategy:** The NHDR’s digital health journey is aligned with the DOH’s medium-term strategy, the **8-Point Action Agenda**.

### 3. Supporting Integrated Service Delivery (HCPNs and P/CWHS)

The NHDR provides functionality critical to achieving the goal of integrated, people-centered care delivered through Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS) and Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs).

- **Continuum of Care:** The NHDR facilitates efficient health service delivery through integrated records management and improves access to public health data. By ensuring health information is easily exchanged between healthcare providers, it enhances consultations and the coordination of care within the HCPN.
- **P/CWHS Operationalization:** The NHDR addresses data and information needs for the integration of local health systems into P/CWHS. The successful integration and full functionality of the P/CWHS, monitored in UHC Stage 3, requires a functional **National Interoperable Digital Health Ecosystem** where the NHDR serves as the single source of truth.
- **Health Workforce Management:** The NHDR provides support to the **National Health Workforce Registry (NHWR)** and the **National Health Workforce Support System (NHWSS)**. The NHWR, which registers all health professionals and their location of practice, will eventually be incorporated into the NHDR. Accurate HRH data is necessary for achieving the UHC goal of adequate and equitably distributed health workers.

### 4. Financial Risk Protection and Accountability

The NHDR supports UHC goals related to efficient resource use and financial management:

- **Strategic Health Fund (SHF) Management:** The NHDR aids LGUs in the operationalization and management of the SHF. PhilHealth and DOH are required to establish and maintain an SHF utilization tracking system, and the required data for this system is considered health and health-related data that feeds into the NHDR.
- **Health Technology Assessment (HTA):** The NHDR framework will support the HTA process, a UHC strategy to ensure that limited resources are used and allocated cost-effectively. HTA recommends funding and coverage decisions to DOH and PhilHealth.
- **Improving Claims:** The NHDR is necessary to support the seamless integration of electronic health records (EMRs) to improve benefit payment schemes and achieve efficient and transparent claim processing, a strategic intervention under the 8-Point Action Agenda. PhilHealth requires the submission of health and health-related data to the NHDR, including health insurance claims.
