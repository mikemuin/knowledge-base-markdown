# PhilHealth Konsulta Payment Scheme Overview

## Basic Information

**Konsulta** (Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama) is PhilHealth's primary care benefit package that provides basic healthcare services to Filipino families. The payment works through a **capitation system**, which means healthcare providers get paid a fixed amount per person they serve, regardless of how many services that person uses.

## Key Payment Details

### Total Annual Payment per Person

- **Maximum amount**: ₱1,700 per beneficiary per year (as of January 2024)
- This applies to both **government** and **private** healthcare providers
- **Private providers** can charge an additional co-payment of up to ₱900 per year

## Two-Tranche Payment System

The ₱1,700 is split into two payments throughout the year:

| Payment Tranche    | Percentage | Amount | When It's Paid | Requirements                           |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **First Tranche**  | 40%        | ₱680   | Monthly        | Complete First Patient Encounter (FPE) |
| **Second Tranche** | 60%        | ₱1,020 | End of year    | Meet performance targets               |

## First Tranche (40% - ₱680)

### What triggers payment:

- A **First Patient Encounter (FPE)** must happen
- This means the patient must visit the healthcare provider at least once
- No consultation needed in following years IF the provider conducted at least one medical consultation in the previous year

### Payment Timeline:

- **Monthly payments** based on number of new patients seen
- Payment released within **60 days** after the 8th day of the following month
- **Private providers**: 2% withholding tax is deducted

### Example Monthly Payments:

| Month    | New Patients with FPE | Payment (₱680 each) |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| January  | 1,500 patients        | ₱1,020,000          |
| February | 2,000 patients        | ₱1,360,000          |
| March    | 500 patients          | ₱340,000            |

## Second Tranche (60% - ₱1,020)

### Performance-Based Payment

This payment depends on how well the healthcare provider performs in four key areas:

| Performance Area              | Target | Weight | What It Means                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Care Consultation** | 100%   | 30%    | All registered patients should get at least one consultation |
| **Laboratory Services**       | 50%    | 30%    | Half of patients should get lab tests when needed            |
| **Antibiotic Medicines**      | 15%    | 10%    | Patients with infections get proper antibiotics              |
| **Chronic Disease Medicines** | 20%    | 30%    | Patients with diabetes, hypertension, etc. get their medicines |

### How Performance is Calculated:

The healthcare provider gets a **Performance Factor** (percentage score) based on how well they meet these targets. This score is then multiplied by ₱1,020 and the number of patients.

**Example Calculation:**

- If a provider achieves a 52% performance score
- With 14,850 patients
- Payment = 14,850 × 0.52 × ₱1,020 = **₱7,876,440**

## Special Rules and Highlights

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **No ATC Required**: No need for Authorization Transaction Code anymore
2. **Photo Documentation**: Patients must be photographed during visits
3. **Telemedicine Allowed**: Can provide services online if properly recorded
4. **New Services Added**: Mammograms and ultrasounds now included
5. **Data Submission**: Providers must upload patient data daily to PhilHealth systems

### For Returning Patients:

- If a patient had medical consultation in the previous year → **Full ₱680 payment** without new FPE
- If NO consultation in previous year → **Must repeat FPE** to get payment

### Private Provider Additional Costs:

- Can charge up to **₱900 extra per year** per patient
- Must pay **2% withholding tax** on PhilHealth payments

## Antibiotic Medicines

From Annex B and C, the **antibiotic medicines** (for communicable diseases/infections) covered are:

| Medicine Name     | Category       | What It Treats                    |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |

These are the medicines counted in **Performance Indicator #3** for "indicated medicines for communicable diseases."

## Chronic Disease (NCD) Medicines

The **Non-Communicable Disease medicines** covered include:

### For Diabetes:

- **Gliclazide** (Anti-diabetic)
- **Metformin** (Anti-diabetic)

### For High Blood Pressure:

- **Enalapril** (Anti-hypertensive)
- **Metoprolol** (Anti-hypertensive)
- **Amlodipine** (Anti-hypertensive)
- **Hydrochlorothiazide** (Anti-hypertensive)

### For High Cholesterol:

- **Simvastatin** (Anti-dyslipidemia)

### For Heart Protection:

- **Aspirin** (Anti-thrombotics)

### For Asthma:

- **Salbutamol** (Anti-asthma)

These NCD medicines are counted in **Performance Indicator #4** for "indicated non-communicable medicines."

## Other Medicines Available:

- **Oral Rehydration Salts** - For dehydration
- **Prednisone** - For inflammation
- **Paracetamol** - For fever and pain
- **Chlorphenamine** - For allergies (hospital use only)

**Key Point:** The performance measurement specifically tracks antibiotics separately from chronic disease medicines because they treat different types of health problems - infections versus long-term conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.

---

**Are there performance factors related to age, i.e. children or elderly?**

Based on the attached documents, **NO, there are no age-specific performance factors for children or elderly** in the Konsulta payment scheme.

## Performance Factors Are Universal (Not Age-Specific)

The **four performance indicators** that determine the second tranche payment apply to **ALL beneficiaries regardless of age**:

| Performance Indicator        | Target | Weight | Applies To   |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| 1. Primary Care Consultation | 100%   | 30%    | **All ages** |
| 2. Laboratory Services       | 50%    | 30%    | **All ages** |
| 3. Antibiotic Medicines      | 15%    | 10%    | **All ages** |
| 4. Chronic Disease Medicines | 20%    | 30%    | **All ages** |

## What IS Age-Specific: Preventive Health Services

However, **Annex D** shows that **preventive health services** are organized by age groups, but this **does NOT affect payment calculations**. These are service guidelines, not performance targets:

### Age-Appropriate Services:

| Age Group        | Recommended Services                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **0-12 months**  | CBC with platelet count                |
| **10-19 years**  | Chest X-ray                            |
| **20-39 years**  | PAP Smear/VIA (can be waived)          |
| **40-49 years**  | Lipid Profile, FBS, OGTT               |
| **50-59 years**  | FOBT (Fecal Occult Blood Test)         |
| **60 and up**    | ECG                                    |
| **70 and above** | (All previous services continue)       |
| **Targeted**     | Mammography (based on risk assessment) |

### Special Note for Pediatric Patients:

The **First Patient Encounter (FPE) form** includes special measurements for **pediatric clients aged 0-24 months**:

- Length (cm)
- Head Circumference (cm)
- Skinfold Thickness (cm)
- Middle Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)

## Key Takeaway:

**Payment is the same ₱1,700 per person regardless of age.** Performance targets are universal across all age groups. The only age-related differences are in the **types of preventive services recommended**, but these don't create separate performance metrics or payment rates for children versus elderly patients.

This means a healthcare provider gets paid the same amount whether they're caring for a baby, teenager, adult, or senior citizen, and they're measured by the same performance standards across all age groups.
