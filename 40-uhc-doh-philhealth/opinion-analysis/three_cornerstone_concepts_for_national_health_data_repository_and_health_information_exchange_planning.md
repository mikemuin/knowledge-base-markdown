# Three Cornerstone Concepts for National Health Data Repository and Health Information Exchange Planning

## Cornerstone 1: Value is Local Before It's National

**Core Principle:** Health information exchange must deliver tangible clinical and operational value at the point of care before attempting national-scale aggregation.

**The Reality:** The primary use case for health information exchange is care coordination within natural patient care pathways: the pregnant woman moving from prenatal care at the rural health unit to delivery at the district hospital and back to postpartum care; the diabetic patient referred from the city health center to the city hospital for specialist care; the emergency patient arriving unconscious whose medical history is scattered across three facilities.

These workflows are predominantly intra-P/CWHS. The vast majority of patients receive their entire episode of care within a single province or city health system because that's how referral networks are structured under the UHC Act.

**The Implication:** HIE implementation must start at the P/CWHS level where it can immediately improve clinical workflows, reduce duplicate tests, enhance referral coordination, and potentially save lives through better information availability at the point of care. Clinicians and health workers will adopt and sustain a system that makes their work easier and their patients safer.

National data aggregation—while valuable for health policy, research, and surveillance—is a derivative benefit that emerges from well-functioning local systems. Attempting to build for national aggregation first creates a system that serves distant policymakers but burdens frontline workers.

**Why This Matters:** Technology adoption succeeds when users see immediate personal value. A doctor who can pull up a patient's complete medication history in the emergency room becomes a champion for the system. A nurse who can transmit lab results electronically instead of calling multiple times becomes an advocate. These local successes create the political will and technical capacity for broader rollout.

Conversely, systems designed primarily for national reporting become "data extraction tools" that frontline workers resent because they create work without providing value at their level.

**Discussion Agenda Question for DOH/PhilHealth:** *"What is the primary use case for the proposed NHDR/HIE—improving care coordination for patients moving within their local health system, or aggregating data for national reporting? If both, which must work first to justify the investment and effort from facilities and health workers?"*

## Cornerstone 2: Data Flows Follow Money Flows

**Core Principle:** Health information exchange must be structured around actual financing mechanisms, not organizational charts.

**The Reality:** The UHC Act creates two distinct financing streams with different payers, different recipients, and different accountability mechanisms:

- **Population-based services** (health promotion, surveillance, vector control) are DOH-funded through tax revenues and contracted to P/CWHS as integrated service delivery units
- **Individual-based services** (consultations, procedures, diagnostics, medicines) are PhilHealth-funded through premium contributions and contracted to Health Care Provider Networks, which P/CWHS constitute as public HCPNs

Both streams flow into and are managed through the Special Health Fund at the P/CWHS level.

**The Implication:** HIE architecture must serve both financing flows. For population-based services, the HIE enables P/CWHS to aggregate and report data to DOH (disease surveillance, program coverage, health outcomes). For individual-based services, the HIE enables facilities to document and validate service delivery to PhilHealth (encounter records, claims validation, quality metrics).

The SHF becomes the natural funding source for HIE infrastructure and operations because the HIE directly supports both revenue streams that feed into it.

**Why This Matters:** Systems that don't align with how money flows are not sustained. If DOH central office funds an HIE but the benefits accrue to LGUs, the system becomes an "unfunded mandate." If PhilHealth requires connectivity but doesn't recognize it in contracting or payment, facilities won't prioritize it. When HIE is funded from the SHF and serves both DOH and PhilHealth contracting requirements, sustainability is built-in.

Once local clinical value is established (Cornerstone 1), the financing alignment makes the business case clear: provinces and cities will invest from their SHF because they directly benefit through improved service delivery and enhanced revenue capture from both DOH and PhilHealth.

**Discussion Agenda Question for DOH/PhilHealth:** *"How will the proposed NHDR/HIE enable P/CWHS to meet their reporting obligations to DOH for population-based services AND their documentation requirements to PhilHealth for individual-based services, using the Special Health Fund as the financing mechanism?"*

## Cornerstone 3: Governance Follows Accountability

**Core Principle:** HIE governance authority must reside where health system accountability already exists under law.

**The Reality:** The Universal Health Care Act establishes Provincial and City Health Boards as the legal stewards of integrated health systems. These boards have statutory authority over health facilities, manage pooled resources through the Special Health Fund, and are accountable for health outcomes in their jurisdictions. They make binding decisions about service delivery, resource allocation, and quality standards.

**The Implication:** P/CHBs must be the HIE governance bodies for their jurisdictions. They decide what data is shared, who can access it, which use cases get priority, and how privacy is protected. Any HIE architecture that places governance authority elsewhere—whether at DOH central office, a new national body, or distributed across individual facility chiefs—will fail because it disconnects decision-making authority from accountability for results.

**Why This Matters:** When governance and accountability are aligned, decisions get made and implemented. When they're misaligned, everyone points fingers when things go wrong and no one has clear authority to fix problems. Data sharing is fundamentally about trust, and trust requires accountability.

With local value established (Cornerstone 1) and sustainable financing secured (Cornerstone 2), the governance question becomes straightforward: the P/CHB that benefits from the HIE and pays for it through the SHF should govern it. This completes the alignment of purpose, resources, and authority.

**Discussion Agenda Question for DOH/PhilHealth:** *"Does the proposed NHDR/HIE governance structure place decision-making authority at the same level where the UHC Act places health system accountability—the Provincial and City Health Boards?"*

## How These Three Cornerstones Work Together

These concepts follow a logical progression that builds a complete architecture:

**Value → Financing → Governance** creates the foundation:

1. **Start with Value (WHY):** Establish that HIE delivers immediate clinical benefit at the P/CWHS level—better patient care, improved referrals, reduced duplication
2. **Connect to Financing (HOW):** Show that HIE supports both DOH and PhilHealth revenue streams, making SHF investment rational and sustainable
3. **Align with Governance (WHO):** Place decision-making authority with P/CHBs who are accountable for outcomes and control the funding

**This sequence matters:**

- Without local value, there's no reason to invest → financing fails
- Without sustainable financing, there's no resources for operations → governance is meaningless
- Without proper governance, decisions don't get made → value isn't realized

**Breaking this sequence creates failure:**

- Starting with governance before establishing value = structure without purpose
- Starting with financing before proving value = funding without justification
- Jumping to national scale before local value = complexity without benefit

## Using These Cornerstones in DOH/PhilHealth Discussions

When reviewing any NHDR/HIE proposal, policy, or architecture, apply these three tests in order:

1. **Value Test:** Does this proposal prioritize delivering immediate clinical and operational value at the P/CWHS level before attempting national aggregation?
2. **Financing Test:** Does this proposal align with how DOH and PhilHealth actually fund services, and does it create sustainable funding through the SHF?
3. **Governance Test:** Does this proposal place decision-making authority where the UHC Act places health system accountability?

If the answer to any of these is "no" or "unclear," the proposal needs fundamental revision before proceeding.

If the answer to all three is "yes," the proposal is architecturally sound and aligned with UHC implementation reality.

## The Bottom Line

These three cornerstones represent a logical progression from purpose to sustainability to authority. They are not arbitrary principles—they are practical requirements derived from how the Philippine health system is actually structured, financed, and accountable under the UHC Act.

Any NHDR/HIE approach that respects this sequence will succeed. Any approach that ignores it or jumps ahead will fail, regardless of technical sophistication or funding levels.

The position paper advocating for P/CWHS-level HIE with national federation is sound precisely because it honors all three cornerstones in proper sequence: it delivers local value first, aligns with existing financing mechanisms, and places governance where accountability resides.

Alternative approaches should be evaluated against these same criteria, in this same order.
