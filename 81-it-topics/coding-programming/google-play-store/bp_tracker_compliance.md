# BP Tracker Compliance

You're asking for key compliance points relevant to your Blood Pressure Tracker app based on the selected text from the Canvas. Here are the crucial requirements and policy considerations:

For a Blood Pressure Tracker app, you'll need to pay close attention to the following compliance policies and requirements:

- **Privacy Policy URL:** This is a **mandatory requirement**. You must provide a direct link to your app's privacy policy, **hosted on your website**. This policy should clearly outline how your app collects, uses, and shares user data, especially sensitive health information.
- **Data Safety:** You are required to fill out the **Data Safety form** in the Play Console. This form details what user data your app collects, processes, and shares, which is crucial for transparency, especially with health data.
- **Content Rating:** You must complete the questionnaire about your app's content to generate an appropriate age rating. Be honest and accurate about any content that might influence the rating.
- **App Access:** If any part of your app requires a login, subscription, or has restricted content, you must provide clear instructions and **demo account credentials** for the Google Play review team to access and test those parts.
- **Policy Compliance is Key:** Adhere strictly to the Google Play Developer Program Policies. For a health app, this means paying particular attention to policies regarding user data, privacy, and the accurate representation of health information. Your app must genuinely function as described in your listing and not mislead users. Discrepancies or violations can lead to rejection or suspension.
- **Merchant Account (if applicable):** If your Blood Pressure Tracker app includes any in-app purchases or paid features (e.g., premium features, subscriptions), you will need to ensure your Google Play Console is linked to a Google Merchant Account to manage sales and transactions.
