# Prioritized Execution Goals of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act

The execution goals of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, drawn from the mandate to progressively realize systemic reform, are centered on restructuring the Philippine health sector, shifting decisively to primary care, and institutionalizing mechanisms for sustainability and accountability.

The following list summarizes the prioritized execution goals, reflecting the systemic reforms outlined in the provided sources:

#### Priority 1: Institutionalizing Local Integration and Primary Care as the Foundation

1. **Integrate local health systems into Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS):** Achieve managerial, technical, and financial integration of fragmented local health systems. This addresses fragmentation in service delivery and streamlines management.
2. **Establish Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs), with Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs) as the foundation:** Organize providers from primary to tertiary levels to deliver a comprehensive, coordinated continuum of care.
3. **Prioritize Primary Care (PC) as the initial and continuing point of contact:** Shift the health sector's focus to primary care, ensuring that PCPs act as the navigator and coordinator for access to higher levels of care.
4. **Ensure every Filipino is registered to a Primary Care Provider (PCP):** Implement mechanisms (led by LGUs, with DOH/PhilHealth assistance) to register every Filipino to a PCP of choice to ensure continuity of care.

#### Priority 2: Reforming Health Financing and Quality Assurance

5. **Institutionalize the Special Health Fund (SHF) and ensure its exclusive utilization for health:** Create and manage the SHF to consolidate financial resources for health services and system development under a single planning and investment strategy (Local Investment Plan for Health/LIPH).
6. **Shift PhilHealth payment mechanisms toward performance-driven, prospective models:** Transition from traditional fee-for-service models to closed-end payment mechanisms (like capitation for primary care and global budgets for hospital services) to improve efficiency, cost containment, and quality.
7. **Implement the Comprehensive Outpatient Benefit Package (COBP):** Progressively expand the current Konsulta Package to transition fully into the COBP, including outpatient drug benefits and emergency medical services, as mandated by the UHC Act.
8. **Institutionalize Health Technology Assessment (HTA):** Establish the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) to guide funding allocation and coverage decisions for health technologies, goods, and services based on evidence, fairness, and transparency.
9. **Regulate primary care facilities (PCFs) and ensure staff certification:** Develop and institutionalize licensing standards for all PCFs and establish certification processes for Primary Care Workers (PCWs) to ensure the delivery of safe and quality primary care.

#### Priority 3: Developing Human Resources and Information Systems

10. **Develop and implement the National Human Resources for Health Master Plan (NHRHMP):** Formulate strategies to ensure adequate, competent, and equitably distributed Human Resources for Health (HRH) across the country, prioritizing deployment to Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDAs).
11. **Reorient health professional curricula toward Primary Health Care (PHC):** Require the integration of PHC and public health emphasis into the education and training programs of health professionals to produce a "primary care-ready" workforce.
12. **Establish the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) and an Integrated Health Information System (HIS):** Develop an interoperable digital health ecosystem (including EMRs and electronic prescription logs) to serve as the single source of truth for health data, facilitating evidence-informed policy and planning.

#### Priority 4: Scaling Up Public Health and Prevention

13. **Strengthen health promotion and disease prevention efforts:** Scale up proactive, effective, and evidence-based health promotion programs and campaigns through the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) to address social determinants of health (SDH) and increase health literacy.
14. **Institutionalize responsive and resilient systems for public health emergencies:** Ensure the functional implementation of the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health (DRRM-H) System within the P/CWHS to guarantee the uninterrupted delivery of essential health services during crises.
15. **Prioritize health system strengthening in Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDAs):** Annually identify GIDAs and implement preferential licensing, contracting, and support mechanisms (HRH, infrastructure, commodities) to ensure equitable distribution of health services.
