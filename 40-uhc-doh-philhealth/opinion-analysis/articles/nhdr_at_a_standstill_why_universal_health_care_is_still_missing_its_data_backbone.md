**NHDR at a Standstill: Why Universal Health Care Is Still Missing Its Data Backbone**

Two years after the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) was announced as the digital backbone of Universal Health Care (UHC), not a single operational component exists. No registries, no interoperability layer, no functioning repository. What should have been the core infrastructure enabling coordinated care and evidence-based policymaking remains stuck in concept papers and workshops. The failure to deliver NHDR isn’t just an IT problem—it’s a direct threat to the implementation of UHC itself.

UHC depends on data. Without interoperable systems, patient information doesn’t follow patients, service delivery is fragmented, and policy decisions rely on outdated or incomplete reports. The NHDR was meant to fix this by serving as the “single source of truth” for health data across the country. But instead of a working network, we have a bureaucratic shell—a plan for submission compliance without the systems that make those submissions meaningful or automatic.

The problem starts with architecture. NHDR has been treated as a centralized data collection project rather than a *federated network of networks* built from the real-time clinical transactions of Province- and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). Facilities are expected to upload files instead of participating in a shared digital ecosystem where referrals, diagnostics, and outcomes naturally generate interoperable data. This “submit-to-comply” approach burdens frontliners without delivering clinical value. Health information exchange should help clinicians treat patients, not add another reporting layer.

Governance is equally broken. Despite the UHC Act assigning accountability to Provincial and City Health Boards, there’s no active implementation authority. The foundational registries—patients, facilities, providers, terminology, medicines—remain unestablished. Without these, true interoperability is impossible. Data standards and identifiers exist on paper, but no agency maintains or enforces them.

The absence of financing guidance makes things worse. Local governments are expected to build health information exchange infrastructure without clear rules on using Special Health Funds or PhilHealth reimbursements to do so. Capacity building is virtually nonexistent. There are no playbooks, templates, or designated test sites where LGUs can learn and adapt implementation.

At its core, the NHDR failure reflects a deeper cultural problem: we keep designing systems for control instead of collaboration. Health data exchange is not about collecting reports—it’s about connecting care. The future NHDR must be built from the ground up, starting with working health information exchanges at the P/CWHS level, each connected through a national interoperability layer. That’s how you deliver value first to patients and providers, and national data flows naturally from there.

Universal Health Care cannot function without a functional data backbone. Every day NHDR remains unimplemented is another day of fragmented care, redundant costs, and missed opportunities for better health outcomes. The technology exists, the frameworks are clear, and the law already mandates it. What’s missing is execution. Two years is already too long. It’s time to stop talking about NHDR and start building it—where care actually happens.
