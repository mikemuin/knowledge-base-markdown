# Key Findings of the Assessment

The key findings of the assessment regarding the progress of Health Information Systems (HIS) implementation across selected Universal Health Care Integrated Sites (UHC-IS) are organized based on seven core eHealth building blocks.

### Leadership and Governance

In the study sites, Provincial or City Health Boards (mandated by the LGU Code of 1991) have been strategically utilized as platforms for HIS leadership and coordination. All key leadership and governance activities were present in Parañaque, Iloilo, and Zamboanga del Norte. The Philippines established national eHealth governance structures as early as 2013, predating the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law.

### Strategy and Investment

Despite the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the UHC Act mandating PhilHealth to "incentivize the incorporation of health information systems" and the use of telemedicine, stakeholders generally **do not receive these incentives**, and some are unaware that such incentivization exists.

Financial constraints are a major issue:

- There is a **lack of clear guidelines** on how Health Care Institutions (HCIs) can utilize PhilHealth capitations for HIS.
- Some LGU-retained hospitals in Iloilo are unable to use PhilHealth capitations to fund hardware and infrastructure due to the need to return these funds to the LGU's general funding pool.
- HIS funding remains **inconsistent and delayed** in areas like Parañaque.
- Batangas reported having **no government programs or schemes** where funding is available for investing in health ICT, HIS services, applications, or infrastructure.

### Legislation, Policy, and Compliance

While compliance with the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) mandate requiring each LGU to designate a Data Privacy Officer (DPO) is technically present, the **DPO function is often not treated as a primary responsibility** in some LGUs.

- The DPO role is frequently an **added responsibility** assigned informally to existing staff, rather than a dedicated position.
- Manpower shortages and Personal Services (PS) limitations hinder the creation of necessary plantilla positions, including DPO roles.
- Registration of DPOs and Data Processing Systems (DPSes) with the National Privacy Commission Registration System (NPCRS) is low across the surveyed provinces, indicating a failure by many LGUs to comply with the mandate.

### Workforce

The **lack of Human Resources for Health (HRH), particularly in the health information system, is one of the most pressing issues** across all identified integration sites.

- The majority of **Information and Communications Technology (ICT) personnel are employed under contractual or job order arrangements**.
- The **Personal Services (PS) limitation** on local government budgets has resulted in a shortage of IT personnel, making it difficult to create permanent plantilla positions.
- Due to shortages, ICT functions are often assigned to existing staff who may lack formal IT training, leading to staff being burdened with additional responsibilities, and data encoders performing high-level ICT tasks far beyond their skills and pay grade.
- High staff turnover results in wasted training investments.

### HIS Services and Applications

There is a **proliferation of multiple systems** (e.g., eKonsulta, iClinicSys, IHomis, Google Forms) implemented concurrently at the local level.

- This overlap means healthcare workers routinely face the **burden of using multiple systems**, often requiring double or even triple encoding of the same information.
- The persistent reliance on **"back encoding"**—collecting data on paper first and then transferring it to digital systems—has become a standard workflow due to the lack of manpower, existing staff being spread too thinly, and the prioritization of patient care over paperwork.
- Utilization of the DOH-developed *iClinicSys* remains low, with no surveyed site recording patient registrations for at least 50% of its population.

### Foundational Standards and Interoperability

**Interoperability remains a key challenge** across all selected integration sites.

- The lack of interoperability stems from multiple factors: the systems are **often not user-friendly**, systems are not mandated (only suggested) leading health facilities to rely on private programs, and there is a shortage of qualified personnel.
- Referrals and patient history among health centers and hospitals are often **still paper-based**.
- Issues with PhilHealth ID number verification and a lack of standards regarding ID numbers lead to **persistent claim rejections**.
- The Department of Health (DOH) is in the process of proposing the adoption of the Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) framework for UHC architecture, but it is **not yet implemented at the policy level**.
- Current PhilHealth electronic claims systems use APIs but are **not compliant with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)** standards, making true interoperability difficult to achieve.

### Hardware and Infrastructure

**Both hardware and IT infrastructure remain key challenges** across the selected integration sites.

- **Financial constraints** result in **inadequate equipment** (e.g., computers, laptops) and connectivity, pushing some facilities to continue using paper-based systems.
- Inconsistent internet connectivity is a barrier, with certain areas (especially mountainous and remote regions in Zamboanga del Norte) experiencing poor or no signal coverage.
- The DOH has provided some donations to LGUs (e.g., laptops) to help address hardware shortages.
- The shortage of qualified personnel to manage systems exacerbates the infrastructure problems.
