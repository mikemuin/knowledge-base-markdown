# Version 2: Achieving Universal Healthcare: A Phased Approach

The "Achieving Universal Healthcare: A Phased Approach" outlines a **maturity model approach** as the guiding framework for Universal Health Care (UHC) realization in the Philippines, breaking down complex implementation into **progressive milestones** across six core "tracks" or "building blocks" of a health system. These tracks are: Leadership and Governance, Financing, Health Workforce, Information, Medical Products, Vaccines, and Technologies, and Service Delivery. This model re-frames the "Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)" with its three defined levels (Preparatory, Organizational, Functional) to emphasize active progression towards UHC. The **8-Point Action Agenda** serves as the overarching strategic framework.

Here is a review of the custom foundational stages, critiqued against existing documents, an assessment of their realistic applicability, and suggested modifications:

------

### Stage 1: Foundational Readiness

This initial stage focuses on **readiness, formal commitments, and baseline assessments**, which are crucial for initiating health system reforms and integration. This directly aligns with the **Preparatory Level (Level 1)** of the LHS ML, which assesses the readiness of Local Government Units (LGUs) to managerially and financially integrate their local health systems.

- Leadership & Governance Track:
  - **Provinces, Highly Urbanized Cities (HUCs), and Independent Component Cities (ICCs) formally commit to integrating their local health systems** into Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). This foundational step is a Key Result Area (KRA) under the LHS ML, and as of 2023, 100% of UHC Integration Sites (UHC IS) had achieved this commitment.
  - **Baseline assessment of LGUs’ health capacity** and corresponding investment needs are conducted, including inventory of facilities, provider capacities, population profiling, and assessment of management support systems (referral, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health [DRRM-H], epidemiologic surveillance, information systems, health promotion programs). This is also a Preparatory KRA in the LHS ML.
  - The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is created**, formalized by a P/CHB resolution and the opening of a dedicated bank account. This is a minimum characteristic for financial integration in the preparatory phase and a Preparatory KRA in the LHS ML.
- **Financing Track**: Baseline assessment of LGU counterpart and expenditure for health is conducted as part of the overall LGU capacity assessment.
- **Health Workforce Track**: **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for Human Resources for Health (HRH)** are completed, covering distribution, staffing patterns, and learning and development needs.
- **Information Track**: **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for health information management/ICT systems** are conducted, including the state of ICT governance.
- **Medical Products, Vaccines, & Technologies Track**: **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for procurement and supply chain management** are performed.
- **Service Delivery Track**: **Review of existing referral systems** is conducted, including service capabilities and available health services. **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for the DRRM-H System** are performed. **Baseline assessment on functional health literacy for health promotion programs** is undertaken for the catchment population.

**Critique & Applicability for Stage 1**:

- **Strengths**: This stage effectively outlines practical and necessary initial steps. The LHS ML reports indicate strong achievement in these preparatory KRAs across UHC IS, suggesting high applicability and success in establishing foundational elements.
- **Challenges**: While assessments are conducted, their *quality* and *usefulness* for subsequent planning can be a challenge. The National Health Data Repository (NHDR) was established partly to address "poor quality and untimely generation and reporting of health and health-related data". This implies that the initial data collection might not always be optimal.
- **Modification**: To enhance realistic applicability, there should be a greater emphasis on **standardized data collection methodologies** and **capacity building for data quality assurance** during these baseline assessments. This ensures that the gathered information is robust enough to genuinely inform subsequent planning and investments.

### Stage 2: System Development & Capacity Building

This stage focuses on **establishing network-wide guidelines, resources, and management structures** to facilitate and sustain the integration of local health systems, reflecting key reforms under the UHC Act. This corresponds to the **Organizational Level (Level 2)** of the LHS ML, covering KRAs important for the organization and management of integrated local health systems.

- Leadership & Governance Track:
  - **Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs)**, with **Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs) as their foundation**, are organized to deliver a continuum of care. This is a core mandate of the UHC Act. PhilHealth is actively piloting PCPN contracting policies in select LGUs.
  - The **P/CWHS is formally organized**, with expanded P/CHB membership and functions, and a strengthened Provincial/City Health Office (P/CHO) including technical divisions, an Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (ESU), and a Health Promotion Unit (HPU). As of 2023, 72% of UHC IS had organized P/CWHS, and 99% had expanded P/CHB membership.
  - The **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH) and Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) are formulated and approved** by the P/CHB. This is a KRA in the LHS ML, with 97% of UHC IS having LIPH as their strategic plan and 96% having LIPH/AOPs concurred by the Center for Health Development (CHD).
- Financing Track:
  - The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is exclusively utilized** for health programs, projects, and activities. This is a consistent financial integration characteristic.
  - PhilHealth prepares for and **pilots the contracting of HCPNs**, moving towards **performance-driven, closed-end, prospective payment mechanisms** like **capitation and global budgets** for primary care. This shift is mandated by the UHC Act and piloting is underway.
  - PhilHealth begins to implement a **comprehensive outpatient benefit**, with the **Konsulta Package** designed to progressively evolve into this benefit, including SDG-related benefits.
- **Health Workforce Track**: An **HRH plan is developed and integrated into the LIPH**. **Reorientation of health professional education curricula towards primary health care commences** (started AY 2021-2022). Guidelines for **Primary Care Worker (PCW) certification** begin development.
- **Information Track**: A **health information management/ICT development plan for the entire P/CWHS is established**. **Functional Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems are implemented** among health facilities, capable of submitting reports. Initial implementation of **Integrated Health Information System Implementation Model (iHISIM)** clinical modules (Stage 1 within 1-18 months) is underway. **Planning for the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) begins**, focusing on national health data standards for interoperability. Mandatory adoption of these standards is in place.
- **Medical Products, Vaccines, & Technologies Track**: A **procurement plan for the entire P/CWHS is developed**. The **Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process is institutionalized**, and the **Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) is established** (within one year from UHC Act's effectivity).
- **Service Delivery Track**: **Updated technical guidelines/manuals on the referral system are in place**. The **DRRM-H Program is formally adopted** through a P/CHB Resolution. **Proactive and effective health promotion programs and campaigns are adopted** by P/CWHS, with at least one module from the Local Health System Health Promotion Playbook implemented.

**Critique & Applicability for Stage 2**:

- **Strengths**: This stage effectively outlines the establishment of the necessary components and structures. Many initiatives, such as HCPN piloting, HTAC operations, and curriculum reorientation, are actively being pursued and show progress.
- **Challenges**: **EMR system implementation remains a significant hurdle**, with only 31% of UHC IS reporting functional EMR systems as of 2023. This directly impacts the ability to have interoperable health information systems mandated by the UHC Act. While guidelines exist for iHIS and data standards, widespread functional adoption is still limited.
- **Modification**: To bolster applicability, there needs to be **intensified technical assistance and support for EMR implementation**, possibly involving the provision of easily adoptable, standardized, and interoperable EMR solutions to facilities. Efforts should also focus on ensuring *actual utilization* and *data submission* quality rather than just system presence. Given the HRH gaps, the development of the HRH plan needs to be robustly linked to actual recruitment and retention strategies beyond just planning.

### Stage 3: Service Operationalization & Sustained Integration

This stage is characterized by the **operationalization and consistent delivery** of integrated health services and functional management support systems, with an emphasis on **monitoring for functionality and impact**. This aligns with the **Functional Level (Level 3)** of the LHS ML, which covers KRAs on the monitoring of functionality of integrated management support systems.

- **Leadership & Governance Track**: The **P/CWHS is institutionalized and actively monitored for performance**, ideally contracted by DOH and PhilHealth. Regular monitoring and evaluation of UHC implementation are performed using tools like the **LHS ML** and **LGU Health Scorecard**. As of 2023, only 8% of UHC IS had institutionalized P/CWHS, and only 4% were contracted by DOH and PhilHealth. This is a significant gap.
- Financing Track:
  - The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is exclusively utilized** for health services and health system development.
  - PhilHealth has **fully shifted to performance-driven, closed-end, prospective payment mechanisms** (e.g., capitation, global budget) for individual-based health services, moving away from traditional fee-for-service models.
  - The **Konsulta Package has fully transitioned into the Comprehensive Outpatient Benefit Package (COBP)** and is actively provided by contracted HCPNs, ensuring equitable access without financial hardship. This includes the operationalization of **PhilHealth GAMOT** (Guaranteed Accessible Medications for Outpatient Treatment) for essential medicines.
- **Health Workforce Track**: There is **increased availability of adequately and equitably distributed health workers** across facilities and communities. Only individuals **certified by the DOH and the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) are eligible to be primary care providers**, targeted within ten years from the UHC Act's effectivity.
- **Information Track**: **Validated electronic medical record (EMR) systems effectively link PCPNs to secondary and tertiary care providers** within the P/CWHS. As of 2023, only 8% of UHC IS achieved this. The Integrated Health Information System Implementation Model (iHISIM) progresses to Stage 2 (non-clinical modules) and Stage 3, where the **iHIS integrates with the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE)** within 34-36 months of the iHIS guidelines. The **National Health Data Repository (NHDR) is operational** as the single point of submission and authoritative repository of health data, with all health-related entities complying with national health data standards for interoperability.
- **Medical Products, Vaccines, & Technologies Track**: An **interoperable electronic supply chain/logistics management information system is in place**. The **Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is fully institutionalized** as a fair and transparent priority setting mechanism. Prices of essential medicines are reduced.
- **Service Delivery Track**: The P/CWHS is actively delivering a **continuum of care**, with primary care serving as the foundation. **Fully functional and coordinated patient navigation and referral systems** are established within the HCPN. The **DRRM-H system is functional**. At least **three (3) modules from the Local Health System Health Promotion Playbook are implemented**, fostering a health-literate population.

**Critique & Applicability for Stage 3**:

- **Strengths**: This stage outlines the crucial operationalization of services and systems, demonstrating active functioning and impact. It represents the realization of core UHC goals at the local level.
- **Challenges**: The current LHS ML data indicates **significant gaps in achieving the "Functional" level KRAs**. For instance, only a small percentage of UHC IS have institutionalized P/CWHS or fully linked EMR systems. This suggests that transitioning from organized structures (Stage 2) to sustained, high-performing operations (Stage 3) is the most challenging phase. The full shift to performance-driven financing and comprehensive outpatient benefits, while planned, is still in various stages of piloting and transition (e.g., GAMOT is being tested in Q3-Q4 2024).
- **Modification**: Given the current low achievement in "Functional" KRAs, **a more robust and sustained focus on monitoring, evaluation, and adaptive management is critical**. Mechanisms for rapid identification of operational bottlenecks and targeted, hands-on support for LGUs to overcome these challenges are essential. Emphasis should be placed on **incentivizing and empowering local implementers** to drive actual service delivery and system functionality.

### Final Stage: Universal Health Care Realization

This is the ultimate vision, signifying the achievement of a **comprehensive, integrated, and people-centered health system**.

- **All Filipinos are guaranteed equitable access to quality and affordable health care goods and services and are protected against financial risk**.
- **Better health outcomes are universally achieved**, indicating an improved overall health status of the population.
- The health system is **responsive to the needs of the people**, consistently demonstrating efficiency, equity, and high quality of care.
- All local health systems are **fully integrated** as P/CWHS across the country, ideally mandated by an Executive Order following a positive independent evaluation. This is **targeted for 2027**.
- A **national interoperable digital health ecosystem is fully operational**, with the **NHDR serving as the single source of truth** for all health and health-related data, facilitating evidence-informed policy and planning.
- Health promotion and disease prevention are deeply embedded, fostering a **health-literate population** that consistently makes healthy choices within **health-enabling environments** and under **health-supportive governance**. The **8-Point Action Agenda** provides the strategic framework and specific interventions to guide the DOH and all stakeholders towards these ultimate goals.

**Critique & Applicability for Final Stage**:

- **Strengths**: This stage articulates a clear and comprehensive vision for UHC, aligning with the core principles of the UHC Act. The integration of digital health and health promotion as pillars of this final state is critical and well-defined.
- **Challenges**: The **2027 target for full integration of all local health systems** appears highly ambitious given the current progress in Stage 3 KRAs (e.g., 8% institutionalized P/CWHS). Similarly, achieving a *fully* operational national interoperable digital health ecosystem requires overcoming significant challenges in EMR adoption and interoperability that are still present in earlier stages. The past non-implementation of the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE), despite its goals aligning with UHC, highlights historical difficulties in achieving digital integration.
- **Modification**: While maintaining the aspirational 2027 target, it is important to emphasize that **UHC is a progressive realization**. A more flexible and adaptive approach to timelines, informed by continuous monitoring and evaluation of on-the-ground challenges, would enhance realistic planning. The success of this final stage heavily depends on effectively addressing the operationalization challenges in Stage 3.

**Overall Assessment and Modifications**: The custom foundational stages in "Achieving Universal Healthcare: A Phased Approach" provide a **coherent and logical roadmap** for UHC implementation in the Philippines. They align well with the UHC Act's mandates and the WHO's health system building blocks. The detailed Key Result Areas linked to the LHS ML provide a robust framework for monitoring.

However, the primary challenge lies in the **pace of actual implementation and achieving full functionality**, particularly in transitioning from "Organizational" to "Functional" levels. The current data from LHS ML reports reveals significant disparities between planned achievements and actual operationalization in many UHC Integration Sites.

**Key modifications or areas for enhanced focus to improve realistic applicability**:

1. **Strengthen Bottleneck Identification and Resolution**: Implement more granular monitoring to identify specific operational bottlenecks preventing LGUs and HCPNs from achieving "Functional" status (Stage 3 KRAs). Develop rapid response teams for targeted technical and financial assistance.
2. **Iterative Digital Health Implementation**: Given the challenges with EMR and interoperability, prioritize accessible, user-friendly, and cost-effective digital solutions for primary care. An iterative approach where core functionalities are widely adopted before scaling to complex integrations could be more effective. Support for **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** needs to be robust and enabling.
3. **Adaptive Timeline Management**: While aspirational targets are important, the strategic framework should explicitly acknowledge the progressive nature of UHC realization and allow for adaptive adjustments to timelines based on real-world implementation challenges and successes.
4. **Sustained Capacity Building and Resource Allocation**: Beyond initial capacity-building efforts in Stage 2, continuous training, mentorship, and sustained resource allocation are vital for maintaining functional systems and retaining a competent health workforce in Stage 3.
5. **Evidence-to-Action Feedback Loops**: Enhance the feedback mechanisms from monitoring and evaluation results (especially from LHS ML and LGU Health Scorecard) directly into policy and program adjustments, ensuring that lessons learned from piloting and early implementation phases inform the scaling-up process.
