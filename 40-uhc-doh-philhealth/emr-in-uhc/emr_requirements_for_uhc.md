# EMR Requirements for UHC

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Law recognizes Health Information Systems (HIS), including Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), as the **"essential infrastructure of trust"** required for UHC to function efficiently and sustainably. Achieving successful UHC depends critically on shifting from fragmented data management to integrated, standards-compliant EMR systems.

Below is a comprehensive review and summary of the EMR mandates, features, implications for doctors, and the costs associated with non-adoption under the UHC framework.

## EMR Requirements of the Universal Health Care (UHC)

The UHC Law (Republic Act 11223), enacted in February 2019, explicitly mandates the development of robust HIS that include EMRs. These systems must fulfill several statutory and technical requirements to align with UHC goals:

1. **Mandatory Components:** The HIS framework must include **Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)**, Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and **Electronic Prescription Logs (EPLs)**.
2. **Interoperability:** EMRs are specifically expected to be **interoperable**. This enables seamless data exchange across various platforms used by different agencies and providers, such as the Department of Health's (DOH) iClinicSys and iHOMIS, and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation's (PhilHealth) eClaims submission system. This interoperability is a critical objective intended to support the continuity of care and efficient resource management across facilities.
3. **Mandatory Data Standards:** To achieve true interoperability, the UHC requires the **Mandatory Adoption and Use of National Health Data Standards for Interoperability** (JAO 2021-0002). Key standards mandated include:
   - **Messaging Standard:** **Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)**, which is the global open standard for electronic health data exchange.
   - **Clinical Terminology:** **Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)** for standardized medical documentation.
   - **Client Identifier:** Use of the **PhilHealth ID number or the Philippine Statistics Authority’s (PSA) National ID** for unique patient identification.
4. **Financial Integration:** EMR systems must be capable of transmitting data for financial purposes, integrating with PhilHealth's **eClaims submission system**.
5. **Policy Support:** The required HIS must be supported by adequate legislation, policy, and compliance measures, including strong data privacy frameworks under the Data Privacy Act (DPA) of 2012 (RA 10173).

## EMR Features Key to UHC Success

The successful implementation of UHC, which aims for equitable and accessible quality healthcare, relies on EMR features that facilitate system integration and data utility:

- **Seamless Interoperability (Standards Compliance):** Interoperability is highlighted as a **critical objective**. Using FHIR standards ensures that EMRs can exchange, interpret, and use data seamlessly across different systems and geographical boundaries.
- **Support for Data-Driven Governance:** EMRs must generate **timely, accurate, and actionable** data. This feature is vital for evidence-based decision-making, proper policy formulation, and efficient resource allocation at local and national levels.
- **Continuity of Care:** By enabling the sharing of patient records across facilities (health centers, district hospitals, private providers), EMRs ensure that continuity of care is maintained, preventing fragmented data systems that disrupt patient treatment.
- **Financial Alignment:** EMRs should streamline provider transactions, enabling the **expedition of financial claims and hospital reimbursements** from PhilHealth. Furthermore, EMRs should be designed to link clinical compliance and quality metrics (e.g., adherence to national practice guidelines) directly to evidence derived from the system, aligning financing with improved health outcomes.
- **Streamlined Processes:** EMRs must support services such as Electronic Prescription Logs (EPLs) and facilitate telemedicine, expanding access to care, especially for remote populations.

## What Doctors Should Know About EMR for UHC

As core **Users-Healthcare Workers**, physicians and other medical professionals are central to the success of EMR adoption. They should be aware of both the intended benefits and the current operational challenges:

### 1. The Critical Role of EMRs in Achieving UHC Goals

- **Relevance:** All surveyed stakeholders, including healthcare workers, overwhelmingly view HIS (and thus EMRs) as **"very relevant" or "relevant"** in achieving UHC goals.
- **Care Coordination:** EMRs are the tool that facilitates **strong and interconnected referral systems** among healthcare providers, which is essential for proper care management under UHC.
- **New Standards:** Doctors must know that national data standards—specifically **SNOMED-CT** for terminology and **HL7 FHIR** for data exchange—are mandatory for interoperability and clinical documentation.

### 2. Operational Challenges They Currently Face

- **System Fragmentation:** Providers currently face a **proliferation of multiple systems** (e.g., iClinicSys, iHOMIS, CHITS, eKonsulta, private EMRs). This fragmentation hinders seamless integration.
- **Workforce Burden:** Due to the lack of interoperability, healthcare workers often experience the burden of using multiple systems, which frequently requires **double or even triple encoding** of the same information.
- **Paper-Based Reliance:** Despite the digital mandate, many facilities still rely on paper records due to inadequate IT equipment, poor connectivity, and lack of trained personnel. The common workaround is **"back encoding,"** where staff collect data on paper first, then transfer it to digital systems later.
- **Lack of Support and Training:** Many healthcare facilities lack adequate IT infrastructure and IT personnel. Staff, including doctors, are often assigned high-level ICT tasks despite having limited background, or they may be assigned temporary roles without proper training in IT and data privacy.

## Call to Action for Doctors About EMR for UHC

To accelerate the benefits of EMRs under UHC, several actions are necessary from the medical community:

1. **Prioritize Real-Time, Point-of-Care Utilization:** Doctors must transition away from "back encoding" and utilize EMR systems in **real-time** at the point of care. PhilHealth incentives are recommended to be tied to EMR-generated submissions recorded exclusively at the point of care.
2. **Advocate for Standards and Integration:** Doctors should insist on using a **single, standardized system** and actively support the transition toward compliance with national interoperability standards (FHIR). This helps eliminate the need for redundant data entry across multiple systems.
3. **Engage in Training and Competency Building:** Given the complexity of digital health, doctors and clinical staff should collaborate with the DOH, DILG, DICT, and CHED to develop and participate in standardized training programs to build digital health competencies.
4. **Demand Institutionalized IT Workforce:** Doctors should advocate for the creation of **permanent digital health positions (plantilla items)** in hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs) to oversee EMR implementation and sustain daily support (configuration, data stewardship, user help). This is crucial because relying on contractual or clinical staff for IT functions leads to high turnover and wasted training investments.

## Cost of Not Adopting EMRs Among Doctors and Healthcare Organizations

Failing to fully adopt and implement standards-compliant, interoperable EMRs has severe consequences for healthcare organizations, providers, and patients:

- **Financial Losses Due to Claim Rejections:** The lack of interoperability and persistent issues with verifying patient identity (e.g., duplication in PhilHealth ID numbers) lead to a **persistent problem of claim rejections and reimbursement concerns**. This directly affects patients' ability to acquire healthcare funding and strains the financial stability of healthcare organizations.
- **Disruption of Continuity of Care:** Fragmented data systems and the continuing reliance on paper-based referrals and patient history disrupt the continuity of care.
- **Increased Operating Costs and Complexity:** The failure to adopt standardized messaging protocols like FHIR results in a **proliferation of multiple non-standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**. This means that every single system integration requires custom development work, which **significantly increases development costs and complexity** while reducing system reliability and data consistency.
- **Staff Inefficiency and Burnout:** Healthcare workers are forced to perform **double or triple encoding** of the same information across disparate systems, wasting time and diverting limited human resources away from direct patient care.
- **Stalled UHC Implementation:** Ultimately, systemic issues like fragmented EMR governance and uneven implementation hinder the government's ability to deliver **efficient, transparent, and equitable health services**, stalling the full realization of the UHC Law's goals.
