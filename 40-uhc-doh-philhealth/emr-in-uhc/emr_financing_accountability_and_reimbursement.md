# EMR Financing Accountability and Reimbursement

This is an excellent summary of the core concepts driving the digital transformation of health finance under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act. Essentially, the government is moving away from the old system of simply paying for every service performed, toward a structure where health funding is tied directly to the quality of care and successful patient outcomes, and digital records are the mechanism for proving that quality.

Here is an explanation of those concepts in layman's terms:

### 1. PhilHealth Moving Toward Performance-Driven Payment Mechanisms

**Layman's Explanation:** PhilHealth is changing how it pays doctors and hospitals. Instead of the old system where providers were paid for every single service they performed (**fee-for-service**), which could sometimes encourage unnecessary procedures, PhilHealth is shifting to paying providers based on achieving certain results and managing patient health effectively (**performance-driven payments**).

This new approach, often using methods like a **"global budget"** or **"capitation"** (a fixed amount per patient per period), aims to ensure the money is spent wisely to deliver quality, equitable, and cost-effective services. These new mechanisms are mandated for contracted networks and apex hospitals.

### 2. EMRs Track Utilization and Performance

**Layman's Explanation:** The Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are not just digital file folders for patient charts; they are tools that track how efficiently and how often health services are used (**utilization**) and measure how well the entire health system or individual provider networks are functioning (**performance**).

A fully integrated Electronic Health Information System (HIS) is designed to generate data that is **timely, accurate, and actionable**. This allows PhilHealth to monitor performance indicators, such as utilization rates, and promotes accountability and transparency in health system operations.

### 3. Provider Quality Metrics Linked to EMR-Based Evidence

**Layman's Explanation:** PhilHealth wants to make sure that providers are actually delivering high-quality care, not just submitting claims. To prove this quality, the payments will be tied to metrics, or benchmarks, derived directly from the patient data recorded in the EMR.

For example, quality metrics related to adhering to **national clinical practice guidelines** (like proper chronic disease management protocols) or achieving **improved patient outcomes** will be measured using the data recorded in the EMR system. This financial link encourages doctors and facilities to follow best practices and improve health outcomes, rather than focusing only on claim volume. This concept is supported by strong **surveillance and audit mechanisms** instituted by PhilHealth to ensure compliance with contractual quality obligations.

### 4. EMRs Crucial for Electronic Claims Processing

**Layman's Explanation:** EMRs are essential because they contain the specific module designed to generate the paperwork needed to get paid—the **PhilHealth Electronic Claims Processing** module. PhilHealth, recognizing the fragmented nature of older health information systems, mandated the electronic submission of primary care benefit claims as early as April 2017 to eliminate paper-based claims. This move is necessary because EMR systems must be integrated to facilitate seamless communication between the healthcare provider and the insurance system.

### 5. Compliant EMR-Generated Submissions Required for Payment

**Layman's Explanation:** For a provider to receive payment, their Electronic Health Information System (HIS) or EMR must be certified as **compliant** with national data standards. This means the system must pass a check called **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)**.

If the EMR system can generate patient data and reports according to the mandated rules (meaning the data can be accurately read and understood by PhilHealth’s central systems), the provider can submit the claims and is eligible for payment. Submission of health data and compliance with these standards is a specific requirement for facilities in their licensing and contracting agreements with PhilHealth.

### 6. Submissions Must Be Recorded at Point of Care

**Layman's Explanation:** The ultimate goal is for health workers to record patient data **during the actual consultation or service delivery** (**at the point of care**) rather than waiting until the end of the day to manually type the information into the computer (which often happens now).

The sources strongly recommend linking PhilHealth incentives and disincentives to EMR submissions recorded in real-time at the point of care. Integrating the EMR into the real workflow automates processes, ensures immediate data accuracy, and, importantly, helps **minimize the data entry burden** that currently distracts frontline workers from delivering care.
