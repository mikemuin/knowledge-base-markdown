## The Digital Crossroads of UHC: Why the DOH Must Stop Being a Software Carpenter and Become the System Architect

**By [Name/Organization advocating for Digital Health Transformation]**

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act has set an ambitious and necessary goal: ensuring every Filipino has access to quality health services without financial hardship. Essential to this vision is a fully integrated and interoperable Health Information System (HIS). While the Department of Health (DOH) is legally mandated to provide free EMR software—a policy intended to support resource-constrained facilities—this strategy has, ironically, become a major impediment to achieving UHC.

Our position is clear: **The national government must urgently pivot its role from application developer to the architect of national digital standards and core infrastructure.** We must stop funding generic EMR software and instead focus national resources on building the robust policy, governance, and architectural standards that enable true system-wide integration.

### 1. The Operational Failure of "Free" Software

Current government-provided EMR solutions, intended as a shortcut to digitization, are failing on the frontline, leading to inefficiency and low acceptance among healthcare providers.

**The Burden of Reporting:** Assessment findings confirm that DOH EMRs prioritize data collection for national-level **statistical requirements** rather than supporting seamless operational clinical workflow. This design deficiency forces health workers into the redundant task of **double or triple encoding** patient information across systems—a problem that severely undermines the goal of integrated care.

**Fragmentation, Not Integration:** The persistence of multiple, non-interoperable systems—including paper records and informal tools like **Google Forms aggregate collection systems**—demonstrates that centralized, free solutions have not solved fragmentation; they have merely added another layer of complexity. In the private sector, which is not compelled to use DOH software, market forces drive innovation and reliable support, leading to better operational results. The public sector deserves the same quality and functionality.

### 2. The Financial Rationale is Obsolete: Activating Local Autonomy

The primary argument for the DOH perpetually acting as a mass software developer—that Local Government Units (LGUs) lack the means to invest in Health IT—is refuted by the UHC Act’s own financing mechanisms.

**The Special Health Fund (SHF) Mandate:** The UHC Act explicitly requires the establishment of the **Special Health Fund (SHF)** for all Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). Crucially, the regulations governing this fund list **"Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology"** as an allowable expenditure category.

**Local Investment, National Oversight:** LGUs, through their **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**, are mandated to identify **investment needs for health information management/ICT systems**. This means the financial resources and the strategic planning mechanisms are already legislated and assigned to the local level.

**The Conclusion is Clear:** LGUs have the financial capability, via the SHF, to procure high-quality, market-tested EMRs that conform to national standards. The DOH's continued role as a developer stifles the LGU’s inherent financial autonomy and discourages the market from competing to provide superior, fit-for-purpose solutions. If the DOH cannot efficiently service the **entire public health sector**, it must enable LGUs to invest their existing and future health funds strategically.

### 3. Reclaiming Stewardship: The DOH’s True Architectural Mandate

The government’s primary contribution to digital health must be focused on **Leadership and Governance** and **Standards and Interoperability**—the indispensable building blocks that enable a UHC-ready health system.

- **Enforcing Standards:** The DOH’s core, non-negotiable role is setting and rigorously enforcing mandatory **National Health Data Standards for Interoperability** through the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework. This ensures that any EMR, whether public or private, can communicate seamlessly.
- **Building the Foundation:** The DOH must shift its investment from applications to **foundational registries** (e.g., terminology services, client registry, health facility registry) and adopt **HL7 FHIR messaging standards**. These components are the technical bedrock necessary for the **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)**—the ultimate single source of truth for evidence-based policy.
- **Architect, Not Carpenter:** We need the DOH to act as the chief **road map architect**, defining the target environment and strategic direction. Diverting resources to application development detracts from this crucial high-level governance required to steer a complex system of providers, insurers (PhilHealth), and LGUs.

### IV. Priority Recommendations and Call to Action

The path to a unified and interoperable UHC system requires immediate, decisive action from national leaders, emphasizing policy enforcement over application development:

| Priority Area                   | Recommendation                                               | Rationale                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Governance and Legislation**  | **1. Enact a Digital Health Law and Executive Order (EO):** Pass a dedicated **eHealth/Digital Health Law** to provide statutory backing for the governance structure and foundational standards. Concurrently, issue an **EO** to fast-track EMR deployment and interoperability roll-out with firm timelines and accountable leads. | Legal and executive authority is needed to protect critical HIS reforms from political turnover and ensure clear, uniform rules. |
| **Financing and Incentives**    | **2. Embed PhilHealth Incentives:** PhilHealth must link reimbursements and network accreditation to the **real-time, standards-compliant use of EMRs**. Discontinue the use of interim solutions (like the eKonsulta solution) to eliminate redundant data entry. | Financial accountability is the strongest lever to drive market adoption and compliance with SCIV standards. |
| **Local Accountability (LGUs)** | **3. Mandate Health IT Roadmaps in LIPH:** DOH and DILG must revise the **LIPH template** to **mandate the inclusion of EMR implementation roadmaps** and associated costs, ensuring LGUs strategically allocate the SHF for quality Health IT investments. | Empowers LGUs to choose and fund the best system for their P/CWHS, maximizing the effectiveness of their allocated SHF resources. |
| **Workforce Capacity**          | **4. Create Permanent Digital Health Positions:** Pass legislation or policy creating **permanent digital health positions in hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs)** with dedicated funding for training. | Addresses the structural issue of the **Personal Services (PS) limitation** that prevents LGUs from hiring the specialized IT personnel necessary to sustain and support complex EMR systems. |
| **Architectural Focus**         | **5. Prioritize Foundational Registries:** DOH must immediately allocate resources to deploying the core **foundational registries** and finalizing the **National Digital Health Strategy (NDHS)** roadmap. | This architectural work creates the common language and infrastructure necessary for true interoperability, enabling both public and private EMRs to connect seamlessly. |

### CALL TO ACTION: Unlock the Future of UHC

We urge the Department of Health, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, and leaders in the Health IT sector to recognize this pivotal moment. The goal is not just to have computers in clinics; the goal is seamless, high-quality, equitable care.

**To the DOH:** Redirect funding away from EMR development and maintenance. Embrace your role as the authoritative architect of standards and policy.

**To PhilHealth:** Use your financial power to demand standards compliance and drive immediate market accountability.

**To LGUs:** Exercise your financial autonomy. Demand and invest SHF resources in operational, standards-compliant EMRs from the private market.

**Let us stop patching outdated solutions and start building the robust, data-driven system that Universal Health Care deserves.**
