**Build It Where Care Happens: Why NHDR Must Start in the Provinces**

The biggest mistake in the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) plan is trying to build it from the top down. A national database that hospitals and clinics are expected to feed is not a health information exchange—it’s another bureaucratic reporting system. If the goal is to enable Universal Health Care (UHC), data systems must begin where care actually happens: in the provinces, cities, and municipalities managing real patients every day.

The law is already clear. The UHC Act places accountability for health outcomes at the **Province- and City-wide Health System (P/CWHS)** level. That’s where patient referrals are coordinated, Special Health Funds are managed, and local health boards make operational decisions. Yet, current NHDR planning still revolves around a national aggregation model. Facilities are told to submit datasets to a central server, with no clear feedback or benefit to the people delivering care. It’s the same old problem—data goes up, nothing useful comes back.

If NHDR is going to succeed, it needs to flip that logic. Instead of making P/CWHS send data to Manila, the system should be designed so that **national visibility is a by-product of local interoperability**. When facilities within a province can share records, referrals, and diagnostics in real time, those same transactions can feed the NHDR automatically. That’s a sustainable architecture: build once for care delivery, and reuse the data for policy and analytics.

This “federated network of networks” model isn’t new—it’s the proven pattern used in digital health systems around the world. Under frameworks like OpenHIE, local systems remain data custodians, while an interoperability layer connects them using shared registries and standards. Each P/CWHS becomes a node in the national network, not just a reporting unit. This approach respects local governance, encourages ownership, and makes every dataset more trustworthy because it originates from live clinical activity.

Beyond architecture, starting in the provinces creates real incentives. When clinicians see that shared data reduces redundant lab tests, improves referral turnaround, and helps patients get faster claims reimbursements, they participate willingly. That’s how you turn compliance into collaboration. A national repository built on provincial value is one that people will actually use.

The challenge is capacity. Most provinces lack technical staff or implementation playbooks. That’s why the national government’s role should be enabling—not dictating. DOH, PhilHealth, and DICT must provide registries, APIs, legal templates, and shared cloud infrastructure, while P/CWHS lead deployment and adaptation. Financing must follow the same logic: national funding for shared components, local funds for contextual implementation.

A top-down data repository might tick a policy box, but it won’t change how care is delivered. A federated NHDR that starts with functioning provincial exchanges can. When the data that informs national policy comes directly from systems used in daily care, it’s accurate, timely, and trusted. Universal Health Care will only become real when its digital backbone is built where the patients are.
