The foundational stages for Universal Health Care (UHC) alignment are designed as a **maturity model**, specifically the **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)**, to guide the **progressive realization** of UHC in the Philippines. This approach addresses practicality by breaking down the complex UHC implementation into **achievable milestones** across distinct **"tracks"** or **"building blocks"** of a health system.

There are **three foundational stages** leading to the **final stage of UHC Realization**. Each foundational stage defines **Key Result Areas (KRAs)** that must be achieved within six core "tracks" based on the World Health Organization's health system building blocks: **Leadership and Governance, Financing, Health Workforce, Information, Medical Products, Vaccines and Technologies, and Service Delivery**. The **8-Point Action Agenda** serves as the strategic framework guiding these efforts.

- Service Delivery Track

:

  - **Updated technical guidelines/manuals on the referral system** are in place.
  - The **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health (DRRM-H) Program is formally adopted** through a P/CHB Resolution.
  - Proactive and effective **health promotion programs and campaigns** are adopted by P/CWHS, with Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) recognized as on-the-ground health promotion officers.
  - The **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH) and Annual Operational Plans (AOPs)** are formulated and approved by the P/CHB, serving as strategic plans and bases for national grants.

#### Stage 3: Functional Level (LHS ML Level III)

This stage is characterized by the **operationalization and consistent delivery** of integrated health services and functional management support systems, with an emphasis on **monitoring for functionality and impact**.

- Leadership & Governance Track

:

  - The **P/CWHS is institutionalized and actively monitored** for performance, ideally contracted by DOH and PhilHealth.
  - Regular monitoring and evaluation of UHC implementation are performed using tools like the **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** and **LGU Health Scorecard**. As of 2023, **63 out of 71 UHC Integration Sites achieved at least 70% of LHS ML Level 2 KRAs**, demonstrating practical progress.

- Financing Track

:

  - The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is exclusively utilized for health services and health system development**.
  - PhilHealth has **fully shifted to performance-driven, closed-end, prospective payment mechanisms** (e.g., capitation, global budget) for individual-based health services, moving away from traditional fee-for-service models.
