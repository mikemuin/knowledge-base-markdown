# [Article] How Do You Rescue a Healthcare IT Project That's Lost Its Way?

## The Emergency Room for Failed Projects

Picture this: You're six months into a major, big-budget hospital IT implementation. The team is working 12-hour days, stakeholders are attending weekly meetings, and everyone agrees the project is "critical." But something feels wrong.

When you ask the IT director what problem they're solving, she talks about "modernizing legacy systems." The chief medical officer mentions "improving patient outcomes." The CFO is focused on "reducing operational costs." The project manager rattles off technical specifications about servers and databases.

Everyone is working incredibly hard, but they're solving different problems.

This is what a lost healthcare IT project looks like. It's not dramatic failure with systems crashing or budgets exploding. It's the slow drift from problem-solving to technology implementation. The project becomes about installing software rather than improving healthcare delivery.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Healthcare IT projects have a peculiar way of losing their purpose while everyone involved remains convinced they're doing important work. The good news? Lost projects can be found again, but it requires emergency intervention.

## The Three Warning Signs Your Project Has Lost Its Way

How do you know if your healthcare IT project has lost its way? Look for these three warning signs:

**Warning Sign #1: The Babel Tower Effect**

Ask five different team members, "What problem are we solving?" and you'll get five different answers. The IT team talks about "system integration challenges." Clinical staff mention "workflow inefficiencies." Administration focuses on "compliance requirements." Everyone is speaking a different language about the same project.

This happens because projects gradually drift from their original purpose. What started as solving a specific problem becomes a catch-all for every technology wish list item in the organization.

**Warning Sign #2: Success Means "Go Live"**

When you ask how the team will know if the project succeeded, the answer is always the same: "When the system goes live." But launching technology isn't success—it's just the beginning. Real success means the original problem is solved.

This warning sign reveals that the project has become about implementation rather than outcomes. Teams celebrate technical milestones while the underlying business problems remain unaddressed.

**Warning Sign #3: The Jargon Test Failure**

Try explaining your project's purpose to someone outside healthcare IT. If your explanation requires technical jargon, acronyms, or detailed system architecture diagrams, your project has lost touch with its fundamental purpose.

Projects that solve real problems can be explained simply: "We're helping doctors access patient information faster so they can make better decisions." Projects that have lost their way require complex technical explanations that leave stakeholders confused about why they're investing millions of dollars.

## Emergency Triage: The Three Questions That Save Projects

When a healthcare IT project loses its way, you need emergency triage. Just like in medical emergencies, you must stabilize the patient before you can heal them. For lost projects, stabilization means returning to three fundamental questions:

**Question 1: What are the problems that need to be solved?**

This isn't asking for a list of everything that's broken. It's asking for the ONE core problem that justifies this investment. Most lost projects have accumulated multiple problem statements over time, creating confusion about the real purpose.

To drill deeper, ask:

- What's the ONE core problem we're solving?
- What happens if we do nothing about this problem?
- Which problems are "must solve" versus "nice to solve"?
- What problems are we explicitly NOT trying to fix?

A hospital might say they need a new EMR because "the old system is slow, staff complain about usability, we need better reporting, and we want to improve patient satisfaction." That's four different problems. The core might be: "Clinical staff spend 40% of their time on documentation instead of patient care, reducing the quality and efficiency of care delivery."

**Question 2: What are the success criteria for the project?**

Success criteria must be directly tied to solving the core problem, measurable during implementation, and simple enough that everyone can understand them. Most lost projects have abstract success criteria like "improved efficiency" or "better outcomes."

Drilling deeper:

- What's the simplest way to measure if we solved the core problem?
- How will we know we're making progress during implementation?
- What would constitute failure?
- How do we measure success without waiting for the entire project to finish?

Using our EMR example, success criteria might be: "Clinical staff spend 25% of their time on documentation (down from 40%) within 12 months of go-live, with no increase in documentation errors."

**Question 3: What does success look like?**

This question creates a vision of the future state when the core problem is solved. It should be concrete, stakeholder-focused, and explainable without technical jargon.

Key follow-ups:

- Can we describe success in one sentence?
- Who benefits most from success, and how?
- What does "done" actually mean?
- How will the organization be different when this problem is solved?

For our EMR project: "Doctors and nurses spend more time with patients and less time with computers, leading to better patient relationships and more accurate clinical decisions."

These three questions act like a defibrillator for lost projects. They force teams to rediscover their original purpose and align around a clear, shared understanding of what they're trying to accomplish.

## Why Healthcare Projects Are Uniquely Complex

Healthcare IT projects don't lose their way by accident. They face a level of stakeholder complexity that would challenge any project management approach.

Consider the six different perspectives that must be balanced in every healthcare IT decision:

**Financial perspective** focuses on costs, return on investment, and budget efficiency. The CFO wants to know how this project reduces expenses or increases revenue.

**Patient perspective** centers on service delivery, care quality, and patient experience. Patient advocates want to know how technology improves care outcomes.

**Staff perspective** emphasizes operational efficiency, workflow optimization, and reducing administrative burden. Nurses and administrative staff want technology that makes their jobs easier, not harder.

**Doctor perspective** prioritizes clinical effectiveness, decision support, and care quality. Physicians want technology that helps them make better clinical decisions faster.

**Process perspective** looks at workflows, system integration, and operational efficiency. Operations managers want smooth, integrated processes across departments.

**Learning and growth perspective** considers organizational capabilities, staff development, and technology adoption. Training managers want solutions that build long-term organizational capability.

The problem isn't that these perspectives conflict—it's that projects often only listen to the loudest voices. IT projects tend to hear most from technical stakeholders and least from patients. Clinical projects might prioritize physician needs while ignoring staff workflow impact.

When projects lose their way, it's often because they've optimized for one perspective while creating problems for others. The EMR that makes reporting easier for administration might make patient encounters more cumbersome for doctors. The integration project that streamlines IT operations might create new workflow complications for clinical staff.

This complexity explains why healthcare IT projects are particularly susceptible to losing their way. With so many competing priorities and stakeholder groups, teams naturally gravitate toward technical solutions that seem objective and measurable, even when those solutions don't address the core business problem.

## The Power of Starting with "Why"

The three emergency questions work because they force projects back to their fundamental purpose: solving problems, not implementing technology.

Most healthcare IT projects start with "what" (we need a new EMR) or "how" (we'll implement this specific system), but they skip the "why" (what problem does this solve?). This sequence leads to solution-seeking-problem scenarios where teams justify technology investments by finding problems that fit their chosen solutions.

Starting with "why" flips this dynamic. When everyone understands the core problem, several powerful things happen:

**Scope creep becomes obvious.** Every change request can be evaluated against the core problem. If a proposed feature doesn't help solve the original problem, it's easier to say no—or at least defer it to a future phase.

**Stakeholder alignment emerges naturally.** When different departments understand they're working toward the same problem resolution, they start collaborating instead of competing for project attention.

**Technical decisions become clearer.** Instead of debating features and functionality in abstract terms, teams can evaluate technical options based on their effectiveness at solving the core problem.

**Success becomes measurable.** Instead of celebrating technical milestones, teams can track progress toward meaningful business outcomes.

The difference between project rescue and project prevention is timing. Projects that start with clear problem definition rarely need rescue. But most healthcare organizations inherit projects that began with technology decisions, making rescue the more common scenario.

The three questions work for both rescue and prevention because they force teams to confront the fundamental question: Are we solving a problem or just implementing technology?

## Your Project Doesn't Have to Stay Lost

Healthcare IT projects lose their way predictably, which means they can be rescued predictably. The pattern is always the same: teams start focused on problems but gradually shift attention to technology implementation, stakeholder management, and technical challenges.

The rescue begins with admitting that your project might be lost. If team members can't consistently explain what problem you're solving, if success is defined as "go live," or if the project purpose requires technical jargon to explain, you need emergency intervention.

The three questions—what problems need solving, what are the success criteria, and what does success look like—serve as your compass back to the original purpose. They force uncomfortable but necessary conversations about what you're really trying to accomplish.

Healthcare IT projects fail when they become technology implementations disguised as business solutions. They succeed when they remain focused on solving meaningful problems for patients, providers, and healthcare organizations.

Your lost project doesn't have to stay lost. It just needs to remember why it started.
