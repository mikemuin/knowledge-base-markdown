# The Progression of PhilHealth Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama (Konsulta) Package

The progression of the PhilHealth Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama (Konsulta) Package is a key component of the Philippines' Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, aiming to transform healthcare delivery by emphasizing primary care services and ensuring comprehensive coverage for all Filipinos.

## Initial Plans and Start

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, enacted in 2019, laid the groundwork for significant health system reforms. As an initial step towards adopting a comprehensive approach to health services, PhilHealth began expanding its primary care benefit package through the implementation of the **Konsulta Package**.

Initially, the Konsulta Package covered select primary care services, which include:

- **Initial and follow-up primary care consultations**
- **Health screening and assessment** tailored to life stage and health risks
- **Access to selected diagnostic and laboratory services**
- **Access to selected medicines**

These services were provided by PhilHealth-accredited Konsulta providers, which could be either publicly or privately owned. To avail of benefits, members would either secure an authorization transaction code (ATC) from a PhilHealth local health insurance office or provide consent for a photograph at their chosen Konsulta provider as proof of transaction. The consultation, health screening, assessment, and medicine dispensing were documented using Electronic Konsulta Availment Slips (eKAS) and Electronic Prescription Slips (ePresS), which were then submitted to PhilHealth. As of June 30, 2024, there were 2,797 accredited Konsulta providers, serving over 23 million registered beneficiaries nationwide.

## Moving Forwards and Planned Enhancements

The UHC Act mandates PhilHealth to implement a **comprehensive outpatient benefit package (COBP)**, including outpatient drug benefits and emergency medical services, based on recommendations from the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC). The Konsulta Package is designed to progressively evolve into this comprehensive outpatient benefit.

Key enhancements and initiatives for progression include:

### Progressive Expansion

The Konsulta benefit package is intended to expand to include existing Millennium Development Goals (MDG) benefits, individual-based services currently funded by the Department of Health (DOH), and other outpatient services as deemed appropriate through health technology assessment.

### Konsulta+ (Konsulta Plus)

This enhanced primary care benefit is being piloted in strategic provinces. It focuses on **preventive and promotive health services** and aims to improve coordination among members of the Health Care Provider Network (HCPN) through patient navigation. Konsulta serves as the foundational primary care benefit for the development of Konsulta+.

### Konsulta with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-Related Benefits Package

PhilHealth Circular 2023-0019 expanded the existing Konsulta to integrate health services from current SDG-related benefit packages. This includes the Outpatient Anti-Tuberculosis Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) Package, Outpatient Malaria Package, Outpatient HIV/AIDS Treatment (OHAT) Package, and Animal Bite Package. This integration emphasizes the role of primary care providers in delivering efficient, high-quality care for chronic diseases and is scheduled for implementation in 2024 in select areas through the Sulong UHC Program.

### PhilHealth GAMOT (Guaranteed Accessible Medications for Outpatient Treatment)

Introduced as a stand-alone outpatient drug benefit package, GAMOT provides coverage for essential medicines through network-contracted public and/or private pharmacies and healthcare facilities. Medications prescribed by Konsulta physicians can be dispensed by GAMOT facilities, with a package value of PhP 9,000.00 per individual for outpatient medication expenses. GAMOT will serve as the pharmaceutical service delivery arm of the Konsulta with SDG-Related Benefits Package and will be tested in Q3-Q4 2024. The number of medications covered expanded from 21 to 53.

### Adjusted Capitation Rates

The capitation rate for the Konsulta package was increased from PhP750 to PhP1,700 to enhance coverage for diagnostic tests, such as breast ultrasound and mammogram.

### Primary Care Provider Network (PCPN) Contracting

PhilHealth is piloting a PCPN contracting policy in select LGUs (South Cotabato, Quezon, Bataan, and Baguio City). This aims to ensure the sustainability of primary care efforts by allowing agile spending through Special Health Funds (SHF), enabled by frontloaded capitation payments.

### HCPN Contracting

PhilHealth and DOH are preparing for the pilot implementation of HCPN contracting policies in four LGUs in 2024, which will include the expanded primary care benefits (Konsulta+SDG), outpatient drug benefits (GAMOT), and All Case Rates - Global Budget.

### Technology Integration

Access to care is being improved through a technology-enabled primary care system that involves operationalizing electronic medical records (EMR) and telemedicine services. Telemedicine or virtual consultations are primarily for succeeding medical consults or follow-ups.

## Future End State

The ultimate vision for the Konsulta Package and primary care under the UHC Act is to achieve a **comprehensive, integrated, and people-centered health system**. This involves:

### Full Comprehensive Outpatient Benefit

The Konsulta Package is slated to fully transition into the comprehensive outpatient benefit package (COBP) by 2025, which will be provided by contracted HCPNs.

### Equitable Access

Ensuring every Filipino has access to comprehensive health services without experiencing financial hardship, aligning with the UHC Act's core principle.

### Primary Care as Foundation

The DOH and LGUs aim to provide a healthcare delivery system where every Filipino has a primary care provider acting as a navigator, coordinator, and initial point of contact for all health needs, coordinating referrals to higher levels of care when necessary.

### Performance-Driven Financing

PhilHealth intends to fully shift to performance-driven, closed-end, prospective payment mechanisms for individual-based health services, such as global budgets and capitation, moving away from traditional fee-for-service models.

### Qualified Primary Care Providers

Within ten years from the UHC Act's effectivity, only individuals certified by the DOH and the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) as capable of providing primary care will be eligible to be primary care providers.

### Digital Transformation

Continual improvement in healthcare access through technology, including interoperable electronic medical records for digitalized service delivery.

### Integrated Monitoring

The progress of UHC implementation, including primary care and Konsulta, is monitored through existing systems like the Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML) and LGU Health Scorecard, ensuring a streamlined and efficient monitoring approach.

The journey of the Konsulta Package is akin to building a house, where it started with a solid foundation (initial primary care services), progressively adding more rooms and features (expanded benefits, SDG integration, GAMOT), and connecting them seamlessly with a smart home system (integrated networks and digital health), all to ensure every resident (Filipino) enjoys a comfortable, safe, and fully functional living space (quality healthcare).
