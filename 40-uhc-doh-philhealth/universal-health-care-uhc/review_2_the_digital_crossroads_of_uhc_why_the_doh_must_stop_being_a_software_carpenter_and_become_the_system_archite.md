## [REVIEW 2] The Digital Crossroads of UHC: Why the DOH Must Stop Being a Software Carpenter and Become the System Architect

**A Call for Strategic Re-Prioritization in Philippine Digital Health**

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, enacted in 2019, envisioned an integrated national health system where every Filipino receives quality, affordable care. The digital backbone of this vision—a robust, interoperable Health Information System (HIS)—was meant to be the engine of efficiency and accountability.

However, the Department of Health (DOH)'s current strategy of providing free, internally developed Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software has created a functional crisis. This tactical choice, intended to ensure access, is now **holding innovation hostage** and actively preventing the full realization of UHC's goals, which are targeted for **2027**.

The government must urgently pivot its role from application developer to the **system architect** of national digital standards and core infrastructure.

### 1. The Disadvantage: Why Fragmented Systems Hold Innovation Hostage

The attempt by the DOH to service the entire public health sector with mass-produced software is resulting in **systemic disservice**. If the government cannot service and maintain the software for the whole public health sector, it must step aside.

- **Failure to Sustain and Support:** The operational demands of maintaining EMRs across hundreds of Local Government Units (LGUs) have overwhelmed DOH capacity. The UHC-IS assessment shows that most local IT personnel are contractual, constrained by local **Personal Services (PS) limitations**. In practice, this means IT staff are burdened with servicing vast regions and that when **"management changes, the project is left in the air"**.
- **Legacy Systems and Workarounds:** The focus remains on statistical requirements rather than operational workflow. This forces healthcare workers into redundant, manual processes—leading to the continued reliance on unintegrated tools like internal spreadsheets used for monitoring concerns, or **Google Forms** aggregate collection systems for essential public health reports. This inefficiency costs time and reduces capacity for direct patient care.
- **Stifling Competition:** While the private sector is free to innovate and utilize superior, high-performing systems (such as *Drainwiz*, as noted by one healthcare institution), the availability of free, yet insufficient, government EMRs discourages LGUs from procuring quality, market-driven operational tools. This disparity holds back the entire public health system from accessing the best technology.

### 2. The Financial Reality: Activating LGU Autonomy

The argument that LGUs are too poor to purchase EMR software—the core justification for the government development model—is invalidated by the UHC financing structure.

- **Explicit Funding for IT:** The UHC Act mandates the creation of the **Special Health Fund (SHF)** for Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). The utilization guidelines for the SHF explicitly list **"Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology"** as an allowable expenditure.
- **Strategic Local Planning:** LGUs must define their Health IT needs and costs, including **health information management/ICT systems**, within their **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**.
- **Conclusion:** The resources are allocated. The government must now trust LGUs to allocate the SHF strategically, compelling them to invest in standards-compliant systems rather than depending on centrally-mandated legacy software.

### 3. The Imperative for Stewardship: DOH's Architectural Mandate

The DOH's resources and focus must be redirected from application support to fulfilling its critical, complex stewardship role as the **overall leader of the health sector**.

- **Setting Uncompromising Standards:** The DOH's primary task is defining and enforcing **National Health Data Standards for Interoperability** and ensuring compliance through the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework. This work is essential to allow seamless data exchange across diverse public and private providers.
- **Building the Digital Foundation:** DOH must prioritize the deployment of **foundational registries** and adopt **HL7 FHIR messaging standards**. These are the building blocks required for the **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)** to function as the **single point of submission and authoritative repository of health data**.
- **High-Level Political Will:** Successfully steering the national digital health ecosystem—involving multiple government agencies (PhilHealth, DICT, LGUs) and the private sector—requires **high-level commitment** and **clear written authority to make binding decisions**. This strategic enforcement, rather than in-house coding, is where the DOH’s limited expertise and funding must reside.

### CALL TO ACTION: The Vision of UHC Realization

We are at a digital crossroads. To move past system fragmentation and achieve **UHC Realization by 2027**, we need bold, comprehensive action that empowers the local level and enforces national standards.

We call upon the Department of Health, PhilHealth, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, and the Legislative branch to secure the data-driven foundations of UHC:

#### A. Policy Enforcement and Strategic Leadership

- **Enforce Unified Digital Governance:** Immediate action is needed to strengthen the inter-agency steering committee with **top executive leadership** and **enforcement powers** that transcend individual agency priorities. This robust leadership is essential to protect reforms from instability.
- **Stop Legacy Practice:** PhilHealth must establish a **firm timeline to discontinue the interim eKonsulta solution** and similarly end the reliance on unintegrated data collection methods.
- **Accelerate Architectural Deployment:** The DOH must prioritize investment and institutionalize the adoption of **foundational registries** and **HL7 FHIR messaging standards**. The **National Digital Health Strategy** must be finalized and implemented immediately to provide clear guidance and technical standards to LGUs.

#### B. Empowering Local Government and the Market

- **Link Funding to IT Roadmaps:** The DOH and DILG must revise the **LIPH template** to **mandate the inclusion of costed EMR implementation roadmaps**. This ensures LGUs strategically allocate the **Special Health Fund (SHF)** for capital investment in Health IT infrastructure.
- **Create Permanent Digital Teams:** The DOH, DILG, and DBM must resolve the structural issue of the **Personal Services (PS) limitation** to enable LGUs to hire and deploy **permanent digital health positions** in hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs). Sustained support requires dedicated, full-time staff.
- **Incentivize Compliance:** PhilHealth must use its contracts to embed financial incentives and disincentives that **reward real-time, standards-compliant EMR use** and **require the exclusive use of validated systems**.

### The Vision of a Unified System

If these architectural principles are prioritized, the Philippine health sector will realize the UHC vision:

- **Seamless Care for Every Filipino:** Patients will experience true continuity, where validated EMR systems effectively **link Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs) to secondary and tertiary providers** within the P/CWHS. Patient records will be accessible throughout the health system.
- **Evidence-Informed Policy:** The **NHDR will be operational**, serving as the definitive single source of truth for all health data, enabling timely, evidence-informed policy and planning.
- **A Responsive Health System:** Funds will be spent judiciously through mechanisms like the SHF, and services will transition to **performance-driven, prospective payment mechanisms** (e.g., capitation and global budgets).
- **Digital Health as a Universal Public Good:** By transforming fragmented records into an integrated, secure, and interoperable digital ecosystem, we protect our health system against threats, streamline administration, and finally achieve the promise of quality, accessible care for **every Juan and Juana**.
