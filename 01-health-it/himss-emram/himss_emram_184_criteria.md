## NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION

### Scoring Methodology
Each criterion is evaluated on a scale that typically includes:
- Not implemented (0 points)
- Partially implemented (partial points)
- Fully implemented (full points)
- Not applicable (excluded from scoring)

### Stage Achievement Requirements
- To achieve a given stage, an organization must meet all required criteria for that stage and all preceding stages
- Some criteria are designated as "required" while others are "advanced" (contributing to scoring but not absolutely required)
- Minimum threshold scores are established for each stage (typically 70-85% of possible points)
- Stage 7 requires on-site validation by HIMSS Analytics

### Philippine-Specific Considerations
- PhilHealth electronic claims submission capability may be considered within appropriate interoperability criteria
- DOH licensing and accreditation requirements are aligned where possible
- Data Privacy Act compliance is embedded throughout security requirements
- Additional considerations for infrastructure reliability in rural areas
- Focus on essential health information exchange relevant to local health system fragmentation

This comprehensive list represents the detailed criteria used to evaluate healthcare organizations' progress along the EMRAM continuum following the 2018 major revision. The exact scoring methodologies and specific required vs. advanced designations may vary based on HIMSS Analytics' current evaluation processes and country-specific adaptations.
