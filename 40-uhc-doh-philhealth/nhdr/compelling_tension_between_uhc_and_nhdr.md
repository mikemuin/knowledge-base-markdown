# Compelling Tension between UHC and NHDR

The statement, "If UHC empowers local units, then the NHDR is counter-intuitive if the implementation is national level first," presents a compelling tension between the UHC Act’s goal of strengthening local autonomy (devolution/integration) and the seemingly centralized approach of the National Health Data Repository (NHDR).

Based on the sources, the implementation of the NHDR is structured specifically to address the failures of the fragmented, devolved local health system and is, therefore, considered **complementary to, and an enabler of, empowered local units (LGUs) and their integrated health systems (P/CWHS)**, rather than counter-intuitive.

Here is a breakdown of why the centralized nature of the NHDR is necessary for local UHC goals, and how its phased rollout aligns with local systems development:

------

## 1. The NHDR Addresses Local Fragmentation and System Failure

The UHC Act and the NHDR are direct responses to the inefficiencies caused by the initial devolution of health services to LGUs under the Local Government Code of 1991, which resulted in a **fragmented public health system**.

- **Fragmentation of Data:** Prior to UHC, the country faced recurring issues of a fragmented health system, characterized by **duplication of efforts and poor quality and untimely generation and reporting of health and health-related data**. The NHDR is necessary to solve this issue by creating a **unified data management and governance framework**.
- **Need for Centralized Authority:** The NHDR is mandated as the **single point of submission and authoritative repository** of all health and health-related data (including administrative, public health, medical, pharmaceutical, and health financing data). This centralization of data acquisition is essential to ensure a **"single source of truth"** for the entire nation.
- **Empowering Local Decision-Making through Evidence:** While the repository is national, its *purpose* is inherently local: to support **evidence-informed sectoral policy and planning for UHC**. For LGUs to be truly empowered, they must be able to plan their services and investments (Local Investment Plans for Health or LIPH) and allocate pooled funds (Special Health Fund or SHF) based on accurate, timely, and integrated data. The NHDR enables this by integrating, processing, and analyzing health data for insights.

## 2. NHDR Implementation is Phased and Synchronized with Local Integration

The UHC implementation follows a **maturity model approach** built on **progressive milestones** known as the Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML). The establishment of the NHDR is intentionally integrated into this local progression plan.

### A. Foundational Readiness (Local Level: Stage 1)

In the initial stage of local integration (Preparatory Level/Stage 1), LGUs focus on **readiness, formal commitments, and baseline assessments**.

- **Information Track Readiness:** This stage involves conducting a **baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for health information management/ICT systems**.
- **Local Planning:** The foundation of the entire system, the **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**, is developed based on this baseline assessment. The LIPH is central to local empowerment as it determines the strategies, interventions, and investment needs of the Province-wide/City-wide Health System (P/CWHS).

### B. System Development and Capacity Building (Local Level: Stage 2)

During the organizational stage (Stage 2), LGUs focus on building management structures and strengthening systems. This is when the development of the NHDR begins at the national level, necessitating local preparation.

- **Local System Development:** The LGU establishes a **health information management/ICT development plan for the entire P/CWHS**.
- **EMR Implementation:** LGUs begin **functional Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems** implementation in health facilities within the P/CWHS, which must be **capable of submitting reports to DOH/PhilHealth**.
- **NHDR Planning and Standardization (National/Centralized):** Simultaneously, **planning for the NHDR begins**, focusing on establishing **national health data standards for interoperability**. This is a critical prerequisite because **local systems must conform to these national standards** to ensure data can be exchanged.

### C. Full Operationalization (Local Level: Stage 3)

The goal of this final stage is the consistent delivery of integrated health services and functional management support systems.

- **NHDR Operational:** The **NHDR is operational** as the single point of submission and authoritative repository of health data.
- **Local Compliance and Integration:** By this stage, the P/CWHS must have a **validated EMR system that effectively links Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs) to secondary and tertiary care providers**. All health-related entities must **comply with national health data standards for interoperability**.
- **Data for Local Governance:** The integrated health information system (iHIS), which includes EMRs, claims, disease registries, and supply chain management, is necessary to **support the local implementation of UHC**. The NHDR’s success is directly measured by its ability to **aid decision-making to support the development of program interventions** and **address data and information needs for the integration of local health systems into P/CWHS**.

## 3. The NHDR Enforces Local Accountability and Integration

The need for a unified national system helps enforce compliance and managerial integration at the local level, which is necessary for UHC success.

- **Licensing and Accreditation Requirement:** The submission of data to the NHDR through interoperable systems is mandated as a **requirement for DOH licensing and PhilHealth accreditation** for all health care providers and insurers. This national mandate forces local health systems (LHS) and facilities to align their fragmented systems.
- **Monitoring Local Performance:** The NHDR is expected to provide support to the **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** monitoring tool and the **LGU Health Scorecard**. These tools are used to monitor the LGU's performance and track its progress toward managerial, technical, and financial integration, forming the core of local accountability under UHC.
- **Interoperability Mandate:** The centralized establishment of **national health data standards for interoperability (SCIV)** ensures that when LGUs implement their EMRs (such as iClinicSys or third-party systems), they can seamlessly exchange data across different local units and health facilities within the P/CWHS. This is key to realizing the **technical integration** of local systems.

In conclusion, the centralization of the NHDR is not counter-intuitive but rather a **strategic necessity** to address historical fragmentation and to provide LGUs with the **reliable, standardized, and evidence-based information** required to effectively manage their integrated health systems (P/CWHS) and realize the objectives of UHC.
