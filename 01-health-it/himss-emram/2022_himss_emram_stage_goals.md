# 2022 HIMSS EMRAM Stage Goals

| **Stage**   | **Components (2022 EMRAM)**                                  | **What This Stage is Gunning For (Technical & Clinical Objectives)** |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stage 7** | Predictive analytics; clinical decision support (CDS); public health reporting; closed-loop processes across all settings; patient engagement; system governance | **Technical:** Enable advanced analytics and real-time data-driven decision-making with full interoperability and system-wide governance. **Clinical:** Support proactive, personalized care, enhance public health integration, and empower patients through engagement tools. |
| **Stage 6** | Advanced CDS; electronic clinical documentation; closed-loop medication administration (BCMA, eMAR) | **Technical:** Optimize clinical decision-making with real-time alerts and ensure medication safety using full closed-loop medication systems. **Clinical:** Reduce clinical variation and medication errors, ensure consistent, safe, and effective patient care. |
| **Stage 5** | Integration of smart devices (e.g., IV pumps); contextual CDS; rules-based alerts | **Technical:** Incorporate real-time data from connected devices to enhance decision support. **Clinical:** Increase care efficiency and reduce harm through timely, context-aware clinical alerts. |
| **Stage 4** | Physician documentation; CDS with guidance at point of care; evidence-based order sets | **Technical:** Support clinical workflows with evidence-aligned templates and point-of-care CDS. **Clinical:** Standardize care delivery and improve clinical outcomes through guided decision-making. |
| **Stage 3** | Basic analytics; structured documentation; system interoperability across some units | **Technical:** Build a structured data foundation with early analytics and departmental interoperability. **Clinical:** Begin using data insights to drive care decisions and monitor clinical performance across units. |
| **Stage 2** | Data-driven decision-making; intra-facility interoperability; active clinical documentation | **Technical:** Enable foundational interoperability and data flow across departments. **Clinical:** Provide clinicians access to real-time, accurate data for safer and faster clinical decisions. |
| **Stage 1** | Digitized medical records (basic); department-level digitization; interoperability begins | **Technical:** Start digitizing departmental records and enable initial system-to-system connections. **Clinical:** Improve availability of patient information and reduce reliance on paper processes. |
| **Stage 0** | Paper-based; minimal digitization; limited or no clinical IT | **Technical:** No foundational digital infrastructure in place. **Clinical:** High clinical risk due to reliance on manual processes, lost data, and delayed care. |
