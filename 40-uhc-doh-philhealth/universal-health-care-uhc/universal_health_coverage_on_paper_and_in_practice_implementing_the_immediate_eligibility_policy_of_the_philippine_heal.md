# Universal Health Coverage on Paper and in Practice: Implementing the Immediate Eligibility Policy of the Philippine Health Insurance System (PhilHealth)

This report, titled "Universal Health Coverage on Paper and in Practice: Implementing the Immediate Eligibility Policy of the Philippine Health Insurance System (PhilHealth)," examines the early implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law of 2019 in the Philippines. It was prepared by Pura Angela Wee Co, Kristan Jela Tambio, Gillian Lauren Garcia, Mary Camille Samson, Reneepearl Kim Sales, Helena Marie Alvior, Maria Alma Mariano, and Matt Boxshall, with support from ThinkWell’s Strategic Purchasing for Primary Health Care grant from the Gates Foundation. The study utilizes a process evaluation design with mixed methods, including key informant interviews and analysis of PhilHealth's membership, collection, and utilization statistics.

Here are the key highlights, findings, and conclusions of the paper:

**Key Highlights:**

- The UHC Law of 2019 introduced the **immediate eligibility policy**, which fundamentally shifted the Philippine health financing system by **decoupling entitlement to health insurance benefits from the ability to pay premiums**. This established a legal guarantee that all Filipinos are entitled to benefits under the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP), regardless of socioeconomic status.
- While the reform aims to redefine universal access, its implementation faces **substantial challenges that undermine its equity and effectiveness**.
- The study emphasizes that the goals of immediate eligibility require **synchronized changes across registration, contribution collection, verification, and claims payment systems**, not just legal reform.

**Key Findings:**

- Divergent Experiences:
  - From **PhilHealth's perspective**, the policy has expanded membership and benefit utilization but created operational complexities in verification and premium collection.
  - From **patients' perspective**, legal entitlement has improved access, but practical barriers such as needing a PhilHealth Identification Number (PIN), documentation requirements, and facility-level capacity gaps continue to limit seamless benefit access, especially for vulnerable populations.
- Operational Challenges (Enrollment, Registration, and Verification):
  - Despite the UHC Law stating that a PIN is not required to avail of health services, having a **PIN remains operationally critical** for providers to file claims and receive reimbursements.
  - PhilHealth has an extensive network of 274 service points and nearly 600 patient navigators (CARES personnel) in health care facilities, which serves as a critical base for implementation.
  - However, **technological limitations**, weak interoperability with national databases (like those of DSWD, PSA, BIR), and unreliable Internet connectivity (especially in rural areas) constrain the policy's effectiveness.
  - **Documentation requirements** remain a significant barrier, often requiring patients to return home to retrieve documents, incurring additional time and costs. While joint affidavits are accepted as an alternative, this raises concerns about data reliability and potential fraud.
  - **Service availability limitations** mean that PIN generation and some verification processes are only available during regular weekday office hours, causing delays in patient discharge, particularly on weekends and holidays.
  - Inconsistent implementation practices across regions and facilities are due to a lack of streamlined procedures and uniform policy dissemination.
  - As of December 2024, PhilHealth has registered 102.7 million Filipinos, representing 91% of the projected population, with direct contributors making up the majority (64.1%). Despite this, the 2022 National Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) indicates that **full population coverage has not yet been achieved**, with one in three Filipinos unsure of their PhilHealth status, highlighting awareness and systems integration gaps.
- Financial Sustainability Challenges (Premium Collection):
  - The decoupling of contributions from benefit entitlement has led to **uncertainty in voluntary payments** from the informal sector, raising concerns about PhilHealth's financial sustainability. There is a perceived "moral hazard" where healthier individuals may avoid payments since benefits are immediately available.
  - **Rigid government budgeting processes** limit PhilHealth's ability to respond to increases in indirect membership (subsidized members) that exceed initial projections.
  - A **dramatic decline in government subsidies** for indigents and senior citizens occurred in 2024, following a fiscal intervention that allowed the government to tap into PhilHealth's accumulated reserves. Congress approved a zero government subsidy for PhilHealth in the 2025 national budget, citing sufficient reserves. This makes PhilHealth's funding model vulnerable to political and budgetary decisions.
  - The premium structure is seen as regressive, with income ceilings effectively taxing middle-income earners at higher rates than wealthier contributors, exacerbating equity concerns.
- Benefit Claiming and Payment Gaps:
  - While immediate eligibility ensures access even with unpaid premiums, the **absence of a PIN can delay or risk denial of claims**, putting financial strain on healthcare facilities.
  - Structural limitations in benefit design persist, with existing caps still restricting access for those with high service needs, despite the removal of the single-period-of-confinement rule and the 45-day annual limit for inpatient care.
  - The No Balance Billing (NBB) policy for public hospitals often requires facilities to seek supplemental financing from other government programs (like MAIFIP) when PhilHealth reimbursement doesn't fully cover costs, creating a **fragmented safety net**. This goes against the UHC Law's intent of streamlining financing and establishing PhilHealth as the primary funder.
  - Out-of-pocket payments remain a **significant financial burden** for PhilHealth members, especially in private facilities, highlighting a gap between formal coverage and actual financial protection.

**Recommendations:**

The report proposes several key interventions to bridge the gap between policy intent and operational reality:

- **Strengthen technology infrastructure and data management:** Enable real-time verification, integrate IT systems across all facility types, and harmonize databases with other government agencies (PSA, DSWD, BIR).
- **Streamline registration and verification processes:** Provide clear guidelines for healthcare facilities, expand the Point of Service (POS) system to primary care, and establish emergency verification procedures.
- **Improve financial sustainability:** Review premium collection methods, develop targeted strategies for informal sector contributions, and advocate for a more rational and politically insulated government funding process for PhilHealth from national taxes.
- **Strengthen inter-agency collaboration:** Establish regular coordination meetings, develop integrated systems for information sharing, and create clear data-sharing protocols.
- **Build implementation capacity at the facility level:** Provide continuous training and technical support, especially for primary care facilities, and develop consistent implementation guidelines.
- **Enhance communication and awareness strategies:** Implement comprehensive community-based programs and mechanisms for regular stakeholder feedback.

**Conclusion:**

The immediate eligibility policy under the UHC Law represents a **landmark policy shift** that affirms health as a right of citizenship, moving away from a traditional contributory insurance model. However, the study concludes that **making this right meaningful in practice requires more than universal legal coverage**. It demands significant **investment in technology, deeper integration across government agencies, a rethinking of premium collection models, and alignment of financing instruments**. PhilHealth must evolve from simply enforcing compliance to effectively enabling access while maintaining accountability through robust identification, monitoring, and fraud prevention systems. Ultimately, the success of immediate eligibility hinges on the Philippines' ability to bridge the gap between policy and practice through strategic governance, adaptive implementation, and sustained investment in public trust and institutional infrastructure.
