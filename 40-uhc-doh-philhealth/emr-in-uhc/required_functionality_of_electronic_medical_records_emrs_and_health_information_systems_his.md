# Required Functionality of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and Health Information Systems (HIS)

The concepts you listed regarding the purpose and required functionality of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and Health Information Systems (HIS) are well-supported across the sources, particularly within documents detailing the implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act.

These goals are frequently cited as the primary reasons for investing in and mandating digital health systems.

Here is a breakdown of where each concept is stated:

### Supporting Data-Driven Governance

The primary purpose of strengthening HIS and EMRs is explicitly stated as enabling better decision-making and evidence-informed policies at all levels of the health system.

| Concept                                                      | Supporting Source Locations (Key Insights)                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **EMRs must generate timely, accurate, and actionable data** | A strong and sustainable HIS ensures that **health data are timely, accurate, and actionable**. The UHC Act and its implementing policies were created to address recurring issues such as **poor quality and untimely generation and reporting of health and health-related data**. The very objective of the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) is to ensure that **quality health and health-related data and reports are readily available**. HIS are crucial for ensuring the **availability, accessibility, and quality of health information for decision-making**. Data must be **accurate, sensitive and timely** for epidemiologic surveillance and public health program evaluation. |
| **Enables better decision-making and resource allocation**   | Timely, accurate data **enable better decision-making, more efficient resource allocation**, and improved health outcomes. The availability of HIS data helps **identify people’s needs** and **spot trends that contribute to proper and up-to-date resource allocation**. The integration of a Centralized Data Management System (DMS) will offer valuable insights, trends, and projections to **empower the DOH and the sector to develop proactive strategies and make well-informed policy decisions**. Business Intelligence and Analytics enable end-users to **generate meaningful data or information for decision making**. |
| **Supports evidence-informed policy and planning**           | The submission of health data to PhilHealth (through the NHDR) is mandated to **generate information to guide research and policy-making**, supporting **evidence-informed sectoral policy and planning for UHC**. The implementation of the Integrated HIS (iHIS) is a strategy to achieve evidence-informed sectoral policy and planning initiatives. The operationalization of the NHDR is based on the goal that its output will serve as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for Health as the basis of health policy and standards, decision-making, health program planning and implementation**. |

### Minimizes Data Entry Burden for Healthcare Workers

The need to reduce the operational burden imposed by fragmented systems is a critical driver for adopting integrated EMRs.

| Concept                                                | Supporting Source Locations (Key Insights)                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Minimizes data entry burden for healthcare workers** | Solutions for frontline workers should **maximize care delivery effectiveness and minimize data entry burden**. The design of EMR solutions must be done with the goal of **minimizing data entry burden**. Currently, front line health workers are **poorly supported by ICT tools; data entry burdens are high (and reduce health workers’ care-delivery capacity)**. Fragmentation leads to healthcare workers **routinely facing the burden of using multiple systems, often requiring double or even triple encoding of the same information**. The use of iHOMIS and other DOH systems often **puts the burden on the point of care**. |

### Upholds Patient Privacy and Confidentiality / Compliance with Data Privacy Act of 2012

Ensuring patient privacy and compliance with national laws is a mandatory principle for the implementation and maintenance of all health information systems.

| Concept                                         | Supporting Source Locations (Key Insights)                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Upholds patient privacy and confidentiality** | The DOH, PhilHealth, health service providers, and insurers **shall ensure patient privacy and confidentiality in the maintenance of health information systems**, in compliance with the **Data Privacy Act (RA 10173)**. Telemedicine consultations require that the **right to privacy of health information shall be protected at all times**. Implementers of health information systems must **ensure the integrity, security, and confidentiality of health and health-related data** being processed and exchanged. The establishment of the NHDR is mandated to ensure data protection at all levels of data processing. |
| **Compliance with Data Privacy Act of 2012**    | Compliance with the **Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173)** is cited repeatedly as a requirement for handling patient data. Specifically, the **DOH and PhilHealth shall implement strong, appropriate, and reasonable data protection measures** as set by the National Privacy Commission (NPC). The process for data sharing requests must comply with **NPC Circular 2020-003 on “Data Sharing Agreement”**. |
