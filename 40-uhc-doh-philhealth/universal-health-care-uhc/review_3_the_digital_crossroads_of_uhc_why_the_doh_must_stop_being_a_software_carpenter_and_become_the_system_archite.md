# DOH should be a System Architect and not a Software Carpenter

**A Call for Strategic Re-Prioritization in Philippine Digital Health**

The successful implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, which aims to guarantee accessible and quality health services for all Filipinos, depends entirely on a robust and integrated Health Information System (HIS).

Yet, the national government’s strategy of developing and providing mass EMR software, such as iClinicSys and iHOMIS, has become a significant roadblock. While this policy was intended to ensure digital access for all, it is now **holding innovation hostage** and actively preventing the national health system from achieving proper integration and efficiency.

The government must urgently pivot its role from an application developer to the **system architect** of national digital standards and core infrastructure.

### 1. The Disadvantage: Fragmented Systems Hold Innovation Hostage

The current model, where the DOH maintains an extensive portfolio of in-house systems—including many that are outdated or struggling with limited functionality—is doing a **great disservice to the entire public health sector.**

If the government cannot provide effective software maintenance support for the entire public health sector, it must step aside and let the market deliver superior solutions. This failure to adequately support its own creations leads to three critical problems:

- **Operational Burden and Duplication:** Frontline health workers are burdened because EMRs are often designed around the **"statistician's requirement at the central office"** for aggregated data, rather than improving clinical workflow. Health providers have testified that the use of such systems feels like an **"added burden"**, forcing them into redundant workflows like **double or triple encoding** patient information across systems. Crucial data submissions, such as reports for disease surveillance or facility performance, often still rely on manual processes or unintegrated tools like internal spreadsheets used for tracking concerns and complaints.
- **Persistent Legacy Systems:** The DOH manages a sprawling array of information systems, with over 150 classified as "Live". Many of these systems, including systems used for hospital reporting (OHSRS) and internal document tracking, are disjointed. This reliance on fragmented systems—some of which are legacy or non-interoperable—wastes time and technical effort that should be focused on building unified data governance.
- **The HRH and Infrastructure Gap:** Free software is useless without the means to run it. LGUs face systemic challenges, as they are unable to hire dedicated IT staff due to budgetary restrictions, such as **Personal Services (PS) limitations**. Furthermore, even when facilities receive donated hardware, the subsequent **cost of acquiring server providers** or maintaining complex IT infrastructure proves prohibitive.

### 2. The Financial Reality: LGUs Can and Must Pay for Quality

The primary justification for the DOH providing free software—that LGUs are resource-poor—is invalidated by the financing mechanisms embedded in the UHC Act.

- **The SHF Mandate:** The UHC Act mandates the creation of the **Special Health Fund (SHF)**. This fund, which pools LGU resources, DOH grants, and PhilHealth payments, is explicitly designed to cover **"Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology"**.
- **Local Accountability:** LGUs are required to outline their investment needs for **health information management/ICT systems** within their **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**. This legal and financial framework already allows LGUs to procure high-quality, standards-compliant EMRs from the specialized Health IT market.
- **The Investment Imperative:** If the government cannot ensure software maintenance and support across the whole public health sector, it must empower LGUs to spend the funds legally mandated to go their way. LGUs must be trusted to choose and fund the best operational systems for their needs.

### 3. The Imperative for Stewardship: DOH's Architectural Mandate

The DOH, as the overall steward of healthcare, must dedicate its resources to its high-level, non-delegable policy and architectural roles.

- **Enforcing Mandatory Standards:** The DOH’s core task is to set, implement, and enforce national health data standards for Interoperability and regulate conformance through the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework. This is the necessary mechanism to ensure that all systems (public and private) can submit, process, and exchange health data.
- **Governance and Priority Setting:** The DOH is tasked with institutionalizing the **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** process as a transparent mechanism for priority setting, which is advisory to the DOH and PhilHealth** for developing policies and determining entitlements. This high-level function guides investment and policy for the entire health sector.
- **Building the Foundation:** The DOH must prioritize the deployment of foundational infrastructure, specifically the National Health Data Repository (NHDR), which is intended to serve as the central platform for all health data. This requires investing in core components, such as foundational registries, and mandating the adoption of modern integration standards.

### CALL TO ACTION: The Vision of a Unified System

The current digital path risks leaving UHC perpetually fragmented and underperforming. To achieve **UHC realization by 2027**, we must commit to decisive, strategic reform that enables the market and empowers LGUs. The DOH must abandon its role as a digital commodity provider and become the true **architect and enforcer** of the national health data ecosystem.

#### A. Policy Enforcement and Strategic Leadership

We require **top executive leadership** and high-level commitment across government agencies to unify direction and protect these critical reforms.

- **Mandate Unified Digital Governance:** Strengthen the inter-agency steering committee with **top executive commitment** and enforcement powers that transcend individual agency boundaries, ensuring stability and alignment in digital health decision-making.
- **Enforce Interoperability and Sunset Legacy Systems:** PhilHealth must establish a **firm timeline to discontinue the interim eKonsulta solution** and similarly end the reliance on other unintegrated reporting methods that cause duplication. The DOH must accelerate enforcement of the **SCIV framework** to guarantee that every EMR used is truly interoperable.
- **Institutionalize Architecture:** The DOH must prioritize investing in and deploying foundational registries and finalize the **National Digital Health Strategy** with clear technical standards and milestones.

#### B. Empowering Local Government and the Market

LGUs must be given the autonomy and the policy framework to utilize their allocated **SHF** resources for the best available Health IT solutions.

- **Link Funding to IT Roadmaps:** The DOH and DILG must revise the **LIPH template** to **mandate the inclusion of costed EMR implementation roadmaps** and dedicated staff training plans. This ensures the strategic allocation of the SHF for quality Health IT capital investments.
- **Resolve the HRH Crisis:** Resolve the structural issue of the **PS limitation** to allow LGUs to hire and fund **permanent digital health positions** in hospitals and Rural Health Units. Sustained support requires dedicated, specialized staff at the local level.
- **Incentivize Compliance, Not Software:** PhilHealth must leverage its financial influence by linking payment speed and economic benefits to providers' **HIS adoption rates** and the submission of standards-compliant data. This enables the market to compete on quality and conformance.

### The Vision: Achieving Data-Driven UHC

By making this strategic pivot, we will transform the health system and secure the promise of UHC:

- **Seamless Care for Every Filipino:** Patients will experience continuity of care where medical records are **confidential, secure, and private**, yet accessible at the point of need across the Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS).
- **Evidence-Informed Governance:** The **NHDR will function as designed**, enabling the reliable collection and analysis of data—including annual **Burden of Disease (BOD) estimates**—to inform national and local policy, budgeting, and investment decisions.
- **A Fully Accountable System:** Accountability will be enforced through robust monitoring systems, such as the **Local Health Systems Maturity Level (LHS ML)** and the LGU Health Scorecard, ensuring that performance is tracked and incentives drive improvement.

**Let us stop patching fragmented systems and, instead, build the unified, data-driven architecture that will finally deliver Universal Health Care to every Filipino.**
