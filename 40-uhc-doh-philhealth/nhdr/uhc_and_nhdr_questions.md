# UHC and NHDR Questions

**1. What is the Role of NHDR in UHC?**

The role of the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) in Universal Health Care (UHC) is to serve as the **single point of submission** and **authoritative repository** of the country's health and health-related data. It is intended to be the **single source of truth for health**. The NHDR is mandated to ensure that quality data are available for **evidence-informed sectoral policy and planning** for UHC, enabling a national **interoperable digital health ecosystem**. The operationalization of the NHDR is a key milestone in the progression toward UHC realization.

**2. Can UHC be effective even without NHDR?**

No, effective UHC implementation is severely compromised and cannot be fully realized without the NHDR. The Health Information System (HIS), centralized by the NHDR, is considered the **"essential infrastructure of trust that allows UHC to function at all"**. The NHDR is required by the UHC Act specifically to address the long-standing issues of **fragmented health systems** and **poor quality and timeliness of health data generation and reporting**, which are functions critical for governance and planning.
