# Review and Re-analysis of the Stages for UHC Implementation

You are correct to seek a review and re-analysis of the stages for Universal Health Care (UHC) implementation, focusing on what is truly **achievable** and **practical** at each step. Drawing on the provided sources, a **maturity model** approach is indeed the guiding framework for UHC realization in the Philippines. This model breaks down the complex UHC implementation into **progressive milestones** across key "tracks" or "building blocks" of a health system.

While the sources refer to the "Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)" with three defined levels (Preparatory, Organizational, Functional), we can reframe these foundational stages to emphasize an active progression towards UHC realization, ensuring each stage outlines **doable and practical achievements**. The **8-Point Action Agenda** serves as the overarching strategic framework guiding these efforts.

The six core "tracks" or "building blocks" for this model are based on the World Health Organization's health system framework:

1. **Leadership and Governance**
2. **Financing**
3. **Health Workforce**
4. **Information**
5. **Medical Products, Vaccines, and Technologies**
6. **Service Delivery**

### Foundational Stages for UHC Realization

#### Stage 1: Foundational Readiness

This initial stage focuses on **readiness, formal commitments, and baseline assessments** crucial for initiating health system reforms and integration. It involves understanding the current state and making the necessary foundational agreements.

- Leadership & Governance Track:
  - **Provinces, Highly Urbanized Cities (HUCs), and Independent Component Cities (ICCs) formally commit to integrating their local health systems** into Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). This involves engaging LGUs through advocacies and orientations on the UHC Act and national policy goals.
  - **Baseline assessment of LGUs’ health capacity** and corresponding investment needs is conducted. This includes inventory and mapping of health facilities, assessment of provider capacities, population profiling, and assessment of management support systems (referral, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health [DRRM-H], epidemiologic surveillance, information systems, health promotion programs).
  - The **Special Health Fund (SHF) is created**, formalized by a P/CHB resolution and the opening of a dedicated bank account.
- Financing Track:
  - Baseline assessment of LGU counterpart and expenditure for health is conducted, typically as part of the overall LGU capacity assessment.
- Health Workforce Track:
  - **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for Human Resources for Health (HRH)** are completed. This includes distribution, staffing patterns (filled and unfilled positions by hiring authority), and learning and development needs.
- Information Track:
  - **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for health information management/ICT systems** are conducted, including the state of ICT governance.
- Medical Products, Vaccines, & Technologies Track:
  - **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for procurement and supply chain management** are performed.
- Service Delivery Track:
  - **Review of existing referral systems** is conducted, including service capabilities and available health services.
  - **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management for Health (DRRM-H) System** are performed.
  - **Baseline assessment on functional health literacy for health promotion programs** is undertaken for the catchment population.
