# Position Paper: Reimagining the National Health Data Repository as a Federated Network for Universal Health Care

## Executive Summary

**The National Health Data Repository remains unimplemented years after establishment, leaving Universal Health Care without its mandated data infrastructure. Without functional health information exchange, integrated service delivery, evidence-based planning, and care coordination cannot be realized.**

**Three problems exist:** architectural misalignment prioritizing national aggregation over local clinical value; governance vacuum despite the UHC Act vesting accountability in Provincial and City Health Boards; and capacity/financing gaps leaving P/CWHS without technical support or investment guidance.

**The University of the Philippines Manila proposes reimagining the NHDR as a federated network-of-networks built on OpenHIE architecture.** This positions P/CWHS as active contributors where data is captured at the point of care during real-time clinical transactions—delivering local value first, then enabling national surveillance as a derivative benefit.

**This redesign requires the following strategic actions from DOH:**

1. Adopt the OpenHIE framework as the NHDR implementation architecture
2. Establish five foundational registries with transparent governance
3. Strengthen Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)
4. Reorient NHDR as a federated network capturing data at the point of care
5. Build capacity through implementation playbooks and test sites
6. Conduct regional pilots before national rollout
7. Issue financing guidance enabling Special Health Fund (SHF) investment with performance incentives

**Implementation must begin immediately—the health of millions depends on building the data foundation UHC requires.**

## Problem Description

**The NHDR's continued absence creates a critical gap in UHC implementation.**

**Architectural failure:** The NHDR is conceptualized as a centralized submission-compliance system rather than a federated network built from real-time P/CWHS clinical transactions. This burdens providers without delivering care coordination benefits.

**Governance vacuum:** No implementation authority exists despite the UHC Act vesting accountability in P/CHBs. The foundational registries required for interoperability—Client/Patient, Health Facility, Health Provider, Terminology, and Product/Medicines—remain unestablished and ungoverned.

**Capacity and financing gaps:** P/CWHS lack structured technical support, implementation playbooks, and clear guidance on using Special Health Funds for HIE infrastructure. Financing mechanisms fail to incentivize standards conformance or interoperability investment.

**Standards without implementation:** The SCIV process exists on paper but lacks pilot validation, operational testing, or practical enforcement mechanisms to ensure reliable exchange at scale.

**The result: UHC reform without its data foundation, mandates without execution, and health system transformation at risk.**

## Position Statements

### 1. Adopt OpenHIE as the NHDR Implementation Framework

- **Define NHDR as the Philippines' OpenHIE implementation, comprising three layers**: foundational registries (client/patient, provider, facility, terminology, and products); an interoperability layer (routing, validation, and security); and a services layer (shared health record, analytics, and terminology services).
- **Position the Shared Health Record as one service component**, not the entire repository, holding longitudinal data accessed under strict role-based controls for continuity of care, safety monitoring, and population analytics.
- **Synchronize national master registries with local P/CWHS copies**, enabling jurisdictions to steward their data while maintaining an authoritative national source.

### 2. Establish and Govern Foundational Master Registries

- **Designate, operationalize, and govern five foundational registries**: Client/Patient, Health Facility, Health Provider, Terminology, and Product/Medicines, each with published code systems, APIs, data dictionaries, and clear procedures for identifier issuance, correction, and deduplication.
- **Name authoritative sources** (PhilSys for client identity, DOH licensing for facilities/providers) and publish governance protocols.
- **Enforce the use of registries through the interoperability layer** as a prerequisite for reliable data exchange.

### 3. Strengthen Standards Conformance and Pilot Before National Rollout

- **Review and update SCIV** to cover end-to-end exchange—security, identity matching, referral workflows, error handling—not just file formats.
- **Conduct regional pilot implementations** to identify operational issues at scale, including system performance, governance gaps, and procurement challenges.
- **Establish objective readiness thresholds** (data quality, timeliness, completeness) and refine standards based on pilot findings before requiring nationwide compliance.

### 4. Reorient the NHDR as a Federated Network of Networks

- **Build NHDR from real-time P/CWHS clinical transactions**, not submission-compliance requests, where P/CWHS are lawful custodians and active contributors to a shared health record.
- **Enable clinical and public health data generated during care delivery** to flow through an interoperability layer that carries the required identifiers.
- **Derive national insight from transactions used for care coordination**, positioning P/CWHS as partners, not reporting units.

### 5. Build Capacity Through Practical Implementation Support

- **Establish a national capacity-building program** with implementation playbooks covering registry onboarding, identifier use, error handling, and security protocols.
- **Provide model legal templates** for data-sharing agreements and reference technical specifications and adapters for standard transactions.
- **Designate test sites** where P/CWHS validate systems before national deployment.

### 6. Issue Financing Guidance to Enable Local Investment and Incentivize Performance

- **Issue policy guidance enabling SHF and PhilHealth mechanisms to support HIE**, including SHF investment in P/CWHS infrastructure (registry operations, connectivity, maintenance)
- **Create performance incentives** tied to measurable outcomes (registry completeness, data timeliness and quality, referral completion rates, system availability)
- **Require demonstrated standards conformance** as a condition for LGU procurement and PhilHealth contracting.

## Conclusion

**The NHDR failure threatens UHC implementation, but the path forward is clear.** A federated network-of-networks architecture built on OpenHIE principles, empowered P/CWHS governance, established foundational registries, comprehensive capacity building, and aligned financing mechanisms can transform the NHDR from stalled policy into functional infrastructure. This approach delivers clinical value where care happens, respects the legal accountability structure established by the UHC Act, and creates sustainable local ownership. **Two years of inaction is two years of UHC reform without its data foundation. The health of millions depends on getting this right. Implementation must begin now.**
