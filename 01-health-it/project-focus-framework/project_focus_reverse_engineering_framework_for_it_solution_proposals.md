# Reverse Engineering Framework for IT Solution Proposals

## Evaluating Whether Solutions Address Real Problems

## Purpose

This framework evaluates existing IT solution proposals by working backwards from the proposed solution to identify the real problem it claims to solve, then assesses whether the solution actually addresses the core issue or just treats symptoms.

## Step 1: Solution Deconstruction

### What is the proposed solution actually doing?

**Technical Analysis:**

- What specific technology/system is being proposed?
- What functions will it perform?
- What processes will it change or replace?
- What data will it capture, process, or report?

**Scope Analysis:**

- Who will use this solution?
- What departments/workflows are affected?
- What systems will it integrate with or replace?
- What is the implementation timeline and approach?

**Resource Analysis:**

- What is the total cost (initial + ongoing)?
- What staff time/training is required?
- What infrastructure changes are needed?
- What are the maintenance/support requirements?

## Step 2: Problem Archaeology

### What problem is this solution claiming to solve?

**Surface Problem Identification:**

- What problem statement (if any) is provided in the proposal?
- What pain points are mentioned as justification?
- What current state issues are highlighted?
- What "benefits" are promised?

**Symptom vs. Root Cause Analysis:**

- Is the stated problem a symptom of a deeper issue?
- What happens before the stated problem occurs?
- What business process is truly broken?
- Are we solving a people problem with technology?

**Problem Validation Questions:**

- How widespread is this problem?
- What is the actual impact/cost of the current problem?
- Who is most affected by this problem?
- What evidence exists that this is a real problem vs. a perceived one?

## Step 3: Multi-Domain Reality Check

Apply the 6-domain perspective to uncover hidden problems or confirm real ones:

### Financial Domain

- **What financial problem exists?** What's the real cost of the current state?
- **What financial outcome is expected?** ROI, cost savings, revenue impact?
- **Does the solution cost match the problem magnitude?**

### Patient Domain (External Service)

- **What patient experience problem exists?** Access, quality, satisfaction issues?
- **How will patients benefit from this solution?** Measurable improvements?
- **Is this solving a patient problem or a provider convenience issue?**

### Staff Domain (Internal Efficiency)

- **What staff efficiency problem exists?** Time wasted, duplicate work, frustration?
- **How will staff workflow improve?** Specific process improvements?
- **Is this adding work to solve someone else's problem?**

### Doctor Domain (Clinical Effectiveness)

- **What clinical effectiveness problem exists?** Decision support, care quality, outcomes?
- **How will clinical care improve?** Better decisions, faster diagnosis, reduced errors?
- **Does this support or hinder clinical judgment?**

### Internal Process Domain

- **What process breakdown exists?** Bottlenecks, errors, delays?
- **Which processes will actually improve?** End-to-end process view?
- **Are we automating a bad process?**

### Learning & Growth Domain

- **What capability gap exists?** Skills, knowledge, organizational maturity?
- **What new capabilities will we gain?** Sustainable improvements?
- **Are we building capability or creating dependency?**

## Step 4: Core Problem Validation

Using the Project Focus Framework's 3 core questions in reverse:

### Question 1: What is the REAL problem that needs to be solved?

**Validation Criteria:**

- Is there ONE core problem clearly identified?
- Is this problem significant enough to warrant the proposed investment?
- Is this a "must solve" problem or a "nice to solve" problem?
- What happens if we do nothing about this problem?

**Red Flags:**

- Multiple unrelated problems listed as justification
- Problem statement uses solution language ("we need better reporting")
- Problem cannot be quantified or measured
- Problem affects only a small subset of users/processes

### Question 2: How will we know the problem is solved?

**Validation Criteria:**

- Are there clear, measurable criteria for problem resolution?
- Can success be measured during implementation phases?
- Are the success metrics directly related to the problem?
- What would constitute failure to solve the problem?

**Red Flags:**

- Success defined as "system implementation completed"
- No baseline measurements of current problem state
- Success criteria focus on system features rather than outcomes
- No clear measurement timeline or methodology

### Question 3: What does success look like when the problem is solved?

**Validation Criteria:**

- Is there a clear vision of the improved future state?
- Does the vision address the core problem identified?
- Can stakeholders easily understand and support this vision?
- Is the vision achievable with the proposed solution?

**Red Flags:**

- Vision focuses on having new technology rather than solving problems
- Future state is vague or requires technical explanation
- Vision benefits only one stakeholder group
- Success vision doesn't match the problem magnitude

## Step 5: Solution-Problem Alignment Assessment

### Gap Analysis

- **Problem Coverage:** Does the solution address the full scope of the identified problem?
- **Solution Overkill:** Is the solution more complex than the problem requires?
- **Solution Underreach:** Will the solution leave significant portions of the problem unsolved?
- **Unintended Consequences:** What new problems might this solution create?

### Alternative Assessment

- **Root Cause:** Would addressing a deeper root cause be more effective?
- **Simpler Solutions:** Could a less complex solution solve the same problem?
- **Process First:** Could process improvements solve this without technology?
- **Existing Tools:** Could current systems be better utilized instead?

## Step 6: Evaluation & Recommendation

### Scoring Matrix

| Criteria                                                     | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| **Problem Clarity:** Clear, significant, measurable problem identified | 25%    | ___         | ___            |
| **Solution Alignment:** Solution directly addresses the core problem | 25%    | ___         | ___            |
| **Multi-Domain Value:** Benefits multiple stakeholder domains | 20%    | ___         | ___            |
| **Success Measurability:** Clear criteria and measurement approach | 15%    | ___         | ___            |
| **Resource Justification:** Investment proportional to problem impact | 15%    | ___         | ___            |
| **Total Score**                                              | 100%   |             | **/25**        |

### Recommendation Categories

**Score 20-25: STRONG PROCEED**

- Clear problem-solution alignment
- Well-justified investment
- Multi-domain benefits
- Proceed with confidence

**Score 15-19: CONDITIONAL PROCEED**

- Generally sound but needs refinement
- Address identified gaps before implementation
- Consider phased approach
- Proceed with modifications

**Score 10-14: MAJOR REVISION REQUIRED**

- Significant misalignment between problem and solution
- Unclear problem definition or success criteria
- Consider alternative approaches
- Do not proceed without substantial revision

**Score Below 10: REJECT**

- Solution does not address a real problem
- Poor investment justification
- High risk of implementation failure
- Recommend problem redefinition and new solution exploration
