# Trauma Case Study - Short Narrative

## Clinical Workflow Analysis Focus

### Patient Overview

Miguel Santos, 35-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, involved in motorcycle vs. jeepney collision on provincial highway, 15 km from Batangas Provincial Hospital (200-bed regional facility). Friday, May 13, 2025, 2:45 PM.

------

## Accident Response and Transport (2:45-3:20 PM)

Miguel's motorcycle collides with jeepney, throwing him from the bike. He remains conscious but experiences severe chest and abdominal pain with obvious left arm deformity. Good Samaritan calls emergency hotline, but ambulance is 30 minutes away. Community decides on jeepney transport. Wife Maria arrives with PhilHealth documents. 20-minute journey to hospital begins at 3:00 PM, arriving at 3:20 PM.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Community-based transport decision due to ambulance delay, family mobilization with insurance documents, informal communication networks.

------

## Hospital Registration (3:20-3:35 PM)

Registration clerk Rosa Mendoza begins patient intake at emergency department entrance. Basic demographics collected from Maria, including PhilHealth Member ID 12-345678910-1. PhilHealth verification attempted but system connectivity is slow, requiring backup phone verification. Medical record number (MRN: 2025-05-001234) assigned. Patient identification wristband created and emergency department logbook completed.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Manual registration process, PhilHealth system connectivity issues, multiple paper forms, duplicate information gathering from family member.

------

## Emergency Department Triage (3:35-3:45 PM)

Nurse Jenny Reyes performs systematic assessment using Philippine Triage Scale. Vital signs recorded: BP 110/70, HR 98, RR 22, O2 Sat 96%, Pain 8/10. Primary assessment reveals obvious left arm deformity, chest and abdominal pain with high-energy mechanism. Patient assigned Category 2 (Urgent - to be seen within 30 minutes) and placed in Emergency Bay 2 with cardiac monitoring and IV access initiated.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Standardized triage protocol application, vital signs documentation, resource allocation based on severity, clinical priority assignment.

------

## Emergency Physician Assessment (3:45-4:05 PM)

Dr. Maria Reyes performs systematic trauma assessment with primary and secondary survey. History obtained from Maria Santos reveals high-speed collision with no loss of consciousness. Physical examination identifies multiple trauma areas with hemodynamically stable patient. Clinical impression: stable patient with multiple injuries requiring diagnostic workup. Orders completed for pain management (Morphine 5mg IV), diagnostic imaging (X-ray chest, abdomen, left forearm), and laboratory tests (CBC, basic metabolic panel).

**Key Workflow Elements:** Systematic clinical assessment protocol, history taking from family, clinical decision-making process, multiple diagnostic order generation.

------

## X-ray Imaging Process (4:05-5:15 PM)

Dr. Reyes completes manual X-ray requisitions for three studies with clinical indications. Nurse hand-carries requisitions to radiology department. Radiology clerk Susan Cruz schedules patient with 15-minute delay due to equipment availability. Patient transported to X-ray room where technologist Roberto Gonzalez performs studies with challenging positioning due to patient pain. Image acquisition completed for chest, abdomen, and left forearm views. Film processing takes 8 minutes in automatic processor. Roberto identifies obvious fractures and immediately calls Dr. Reyes. Films prepared for radiologist interpretation.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Manual requisition process, physical document transport, equipment scheduling delays, challenging patient positioning, film processing time, urgent findings communication via phone.

------

## Radiology Interpretation (5:15-5:45 PM)

Dr. Ramon Mendoza receives urgent films for interpretation. Systematic review reveals left 7th and 8th rib fractures on chest X-ray, no obvious abnormalities on abdominal X-ray, and comminuted radius and ulna fractures on forearm X-ray. Critical findings immediately communicated to Dr. Reyes via phone call at 5:35 PM, recommending CT scan due to rib fractures. Formal reports dictated and hand-delivered to emergency department.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Systematic image interpretation protocol, critical findings identification, immediate phone communication, formal report generation and physical delivery.

------

## CT Scan Process (5:45-7:30 PM)

Dr. Reyes decides CT scan needed based on rib fractures. Family discussion completed about procedure and IV contrast requirements. CT requisition completed with clinical indications. Patient preparation includes NPO status and IV access verification. 30-minute scheduling delay due to routine scan ahead. CT technologist Grace Villanueva prepares room and obtains consent. Multi-phase CT protocol executed with 100ml IV contrast at 3ml/second. Patient monitoring maintained throughout procedure. Grace identifies concerning abdominal findings requiring immediate radiologist attention and calls Dr. Mendoza. Patient returned to emergency department while images processed.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Clinical decision-making based on prior results, patient preparation protocols, scheduling delays, consent process, complex imaging protocol execution, urgent findings identification by technologist.

------

## CT Scan Interpretation (7:30-8:00 PM)

Dr. Mendoza performs urgent CT interpretation identifying critical findings: Grade II liver laceration with moderate hemoperitoneum, Grade II splenic laceration with perisplenic hematoma, and left rib fractures with small pleural effusion. Emergency call made to Dr. Reyes at 7:42 PM communicating critical findings and recommending immediate surgical consultation. Dr. Jose Cruz (general surgeon) contacted for urgent consultation. Detailed report completed and transmitted to emergency department.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Advanced image interpretation, critical findings grading, immediate communication protocol, surgeon notification process, comprehensive report generation.

------

## Surgical Consultation (8:00-8:45 PM)

Dr. Jose Cruz arrives for urgent consultation and performs clinical reassessment revealing stable vitals but increased pulse to 105 bpm. Abdominal examination shows increased tenderness and slight distension. Image review with Dr. Mendoza confirms Grade II injuries. Treatment decision made for conservative management with ICU monitoring rather than immediate surgery due to stable hemodynamics. Dr. Elena Ramos (orthopedic surgeon) consulted for forearm fractures requiring surgical repair in 24-48 hours after internal injuries stabilized. Family conference conducted with all specialists explaining findings, treatment plan, and 5-7 day hospitalization expectation.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Multidisciplinary consultation process, clinical reassessment protocol, treatment decision-making based on stability, surgical planning coordination, comprehensive family communication.

------

## ICU Admission Process (8:45-9:30 PM)

ICU bed 3 assigned and prepared by supervisor Linda Garcia. Transfer orders completed by Dr. Reyes including monitoring protocols and medication orders. PhilHealth verification finally completed confirming active member status and ₱32,000 trauma case rate coverage. Financial counseling provided with estimated total cost ₱80,000-120,000 and out-of-pocket ₱48,000-88,000. Patient transferred to ICU with continuous monitoring established. ICU nurse Jennifer Reyes completes admission assessment and initiates hourly vital sign monitoring. Family accommodation arranged in waiting area.

**Key Workflow Elements:** Bed coordination process, transfer order completion, insurance verification and financial counseling, patient transfer protocol, intensive monitoring establishment, family support services.

## Key Workflow Observations

**Major Delays:** Imaging processes consumed 2 hours 45 minutes of total time due to manual processes, equipment scheduling, and sequential rather than parallel workflows.

**Communication Methods:** Primarily phone-based with physical document transport, creating delays and potential for information loss.

**System Integration:** Limited connectivity between departments requiring manual data re-entry and physical transport of orders and results.

**Resource Utilization:** Single points of failure (one CT scanner, one radiologist) creating bottlenecks during busy periods.

**Documentation Burden:** Multiple manual forms and duplicate information gathering throughout process.
