## Stop Forcing FHIR: Interoperability Must Start From Where We Are

Everyone in digital health circles loves to say “FHIR is the future.” They’re right — but only half right.

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is the most modern standard for health data exchange, and it’s already transforming how systems talk to each other in high-income countries. But in the Philippines, where most hospitals still rely on HL7 v2 messages, spreadsheets, or homegrown EMRs, forcing FHIR adoption today is a recipe for failure.

If the National Health Data Repository (NHDR) is to move from talk to implementation, it must start from where the country actually is — not where global standards say it should be.

------

### The Misplaced Obsession With FHIR

FHIR is not the problem. The obsession with making it a requirement before data can even move is.

It’s easy to see why policymakers fixate on it: it’s clean, modern, and globally recognized. It gives the impression that adopting FHIR automatically solves interoperability. But standards don’t solve structural readiness gaps — people and systems do.

For context: HL7 v2 — the “old” standard — still powers most of the U.S. hospital system. Laboratories, radiology, and ADT (admission/discharge/transfer) data in America still flow through v2 messages daily. FHIR is being layered on top of that reality, not replacing it overnight.

So when we try to skip that evolutionary path — jumping straight from CSV uploads to FHIR APIs — we’re setting ourselves up for a cliff, not a leap.

------

### The Philippine Reality Check

The current digital landscape looks like this:

- Roughly 70% of hospitals still have on-premise hospital information systems or EMRs that were never built for interoperability.
- PhilHealth claims use XML or proprietary flat files.
- DOH programs collect data through Excel or CSV templates.
- Connectivity in rural and GIDA areas remains inconsistent.
- Few local EMR vendors have developers experienced with FHIR resources, servers, or conformance testing.

In other words: the country’s digital health ecosystem is **functionally fragmented** and **technically heterogeneous**.

Requiring FHIR compliance before anyone can participate in NHDR is like requiring electric cars in a country with no charging stations. It sounds progressive, but it guarantees nothing will move.

------

### FHIR as the Goal, Not the Gate

FHIR should absolutely be the future of NHDR — but it must be a *destination*, not a *requirement*.

The pragmatic way forward is a **hybrid model**:

- Accept data from existing formats today (HL7 v2, CSV, JSON, XML).
- Normalize it centrally into a canonical data model.
- Translate it internally into FHIR resources for consistency and long-term compatibility.

That approach — hybrid ingestion, centralized normalization, internal FHIR mapping — gets data flowing now while keeping the system ready for the future.

Progress beats purity.

------

### Why Forcing FHIR Now Will Fail

1. **Vendors aren’t ready.**
Local EMR providers are small, resource-limited, and underfunded. Requiring them to rebuild their systems around FHIR would force many out of business or lead to noncompliance.
2. **Facilities can’t afford it.**
Hospitals and LGUs have already invested in their systems. Expecting them to retrofit everything immediately for FHIR compatibility is unrealistic and financially wasteful.
3. **The technical support structure doesn’t exist.**
There’s no national FHIR conformance testing lab, no local certification framework, and very few developers with deep experience in HL7 resource modeling.
4. **Data maturity is uneven.**
Even if the interfaces were ready, the data quality behind them often isn’t. Missing IDs, inconsistent codes, and incomplete records will break even the most compliant FHIR API.

FHIR assumes clean, structured, semantically consistent data — and that’s exactly what the Philippines doesn’t have yet.

------

### What Readiness Actually Looks Like

Before talking about FHIR readiness, the country needs three foundational layers in place:

1. **Canonical Data Model**
Define what each dataset should contain, as discussed in the previous article. You can’t standardize transport (FHIR) before standardizing meaning.
2. **Foundational Registries**
Patient, facility, provider, terminology, and product registries must be operational to anchor the FHIR resources. Otherwise, even perfect APIs will deliver unreliable data.
3. **Interoperability Layer**
The NHDR needs a health information mediator — a translation engine that can ingest multiple formats and convert them internally to FHIR bundles. This protects submitters from unnecessary complexity while ensuring consistency downstream.

Only once these exist should FHIR be mandated for direct submissions.

------

### A Smarter Way Forward

The practical strategy is incremental FHIR adoption in **three stages**:

#### Stage 1: Start With What Exists (2025–2026)

- Accept HL7 v2, CSV, and JSON from facilities.
- Use a middleware layer (Mirth, Rhapsody, or OpenHIM) to normalize data.
- Convert internally to FHIR bundles for NHDR storage and exchange.
- Provide submitters with schema validation and automated feedback.

#### Stage 2: Build Capacity (2026–2027)

- Establish a **FHIR Sandbox** — a test environment for vendors to experiment with APIs and validation tools.
- Train regional health IT teams and EMR developers on HL7 FHIR basics.
- Launch pilot FHIR-based workflows in selected facilities (e.g., eReferral, eClaims).

#### Stage 3: Mandate Gradual Compliance (2028–2030)

- Make FHIR conformance mandatory only for *new* systems and contracts.
- Link PhilHealth accreditation and DOH licensing to data quality and standards readiness.
- Fully transition the NHDR to a FHIR-native backend while maintaining backward compatibility for legacy submissions.

That’s a timeline that balances ambition with feasibility. It creates real interoperability instead of paper compliance.

------

### What This Hybrid Approach Enables

- **Immediate data flow.** No more waiting for all facilities to upgrade before anything starts moving.
- **Centralized standardization.** The NHDR mediates and enforces consistency without disrupting existing systems.
- **Gradual capacity building.** Vendors and hospitals gain time and support to modernize sustainably.
- **Future-proof architecture.** The internal FHIR layer ensures the system can evolve with global standards.

This is how other countries did it. Rwanda, Tanzania, and even the UK started hybrid. The U.S. still runs hybrid. Only after years of incremental evolution did FHIR become the common language — and even then, legacy formats never disappeared completely.

------

### The Bigger Lesson: Don’t Confuse Standards With Strategy

Technology standards are tools, not strategies.
The Philippines has fallen into a pattern of chasing compliance with global trends — ISO, HL7, FHIR, whatever acronym dominates the year — without addressing the structural issues underneath.

The goal isn’t to be “FHIR-compliant.”
The goal is to have accurate, timely, interoperable health data that supports patient care and policymaking. FHIR just happens to be the best current vehicle for that goal — not its prerequisite.

------

### The Role of Policy and Governance

Government’s role isn’t to pick a standard and force everyone to follow it; it’s to create an ecosystem where standards adoption is practical and beneficial.

That means:

- **Mandating data quality, not formats.** Require that datasets meet completeness and consistency thresholds — not that they all speak FHIR immediately.
- **Providing shared infrastructure.** Offer APIs, sandbox environments, and conformance tools through DOH or DICT to reduce vendor burden.
- **Offering incentives.** Tie FHIR adoption to faster claims processing, technical assistance, or access to innovation grants.

You can’t regulate readiness into existence. You have to build it.

------

### Progress Over Perfection

If NHDR waits for every system in the country to become FHIR-capable, it will never launch.
If it starts collecting and normalizing data now — even in older formats — it can begin creating value immediately while setting the stage for full compliance later.

Progress is better than theoretical perfection.

FHIR will come naturally when the ecosystem is ready. But the NHDR can’t afford to keep waiting for readiness that will never arrive on its own.

------

### The Bottom Line

FHIR is the future. But it’s not the starting line.

The Philippines must build its NHDR around hybrid ingestion, canonical data alignment, and incremental readiness. Forcing FHIR now is like trying to build a skyscraper without pouring the foundation.

If we start where we are, we can move forward.
If we keep insisting on where we wish we were, we’ll stay stuck in the same loop of plans, pilots, and promises.

Interoperability doesn’t start with standards. It starts with common sense.
