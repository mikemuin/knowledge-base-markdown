# Healthcare IT Project Focus Framework

## Core Foundation Questions

### 1. What are the problems that need to be solved?

**Focus Clarification:**

- What's the ONE core problem we're solving?
- What happens if we do nothing? (urgency/consequences)
- Which problems are "must solve" vs "nice to solve"? (prioritization)
- What are we NOT trying to fix? (boundary definition)

**Reality Check:**

- What would we stop doing if we took this on? (forces trade-off thinking)
- If we had half the budget/time, what would we still do? (identifies true priorities)

### 2. What are the success criteria for the project?

**Measurement Framework:**

- What's the simplest way to measure if we solved it? (prevents criteria bloat)
- How will we know we're on track during implementation? (milestone indicators)
- What would constitute failure? (failure criteria as important as success criteria)
- How do we measure progress without waiting for full implementation?

### 3. What does success look like?

**Vision Clarity:**

- Can we describe success in one sentence? (keeps vision clear)
- Who benefits most from success, and how? (stakeholder value)
- What does "done" actually mean? (completion definition)
- What does 'better than today' look like at the final state?

## Transition State Management

Healthcare IT implementations rarely allow for "big bang" approaches. Managing transition states while maintaining focus on the core objectives is critical to project success.

### Transition State Foundation Questions

**Value Delivery:**

- What's the minimum viable improvement at each transition state?
- If we had to stop at any transition state, would we have solved something meaningful?
- Which transition state benefits can we celebrate vs. which are just stepping stones?

**Progress Alignment:**

- What does each transition state need to accomplish to keep us moving toward the goal?
- Does this transition state move us closer to solving the core problem, or are we just implementing technology?
- How does this phase advance our success criteria without compromising the final vision?

**Boundary Management:**

- What problems do we NOT solve in Phase 1, 2, etc.? (prevents scope creep per phase)
- What trade-offs are we making in this transition state, and are they acceptable?
- How do we maintain patient safety and care continuity during this transition?

### Transition State Focus Principles

**Each Phase Must:**

1. **Solve a meaningful portion of the core problem** - not just implement technology
2. **Advance measurable progress** toward the success criteria
3. **Maintain operational stability** - especially critical in healthcare environments
4. **Build foundation** for the next phase without over-engineering

**Phase Planning Litmus Tests:**

- Can we clearly articulate why this transition state exists?
- Does skipping this phase significantly increase risk or reduce benefit?
- Are we building this phase to serve the final goal or just to make the transition easier?

## Alignment & Focus Maintenance

### Weekly Litmus Tests for Project Managers:

- Are we still solving the original problem, or are we solving the problem we discovered along the way?
- When someone asks what this project is about, what do we all say? (tests message consistency)
- Are our current phase activities advancing the core success criteria?

### Critical Assumption Check:

- What assumptions are we making that could derail this project?
- What would we do differently if our key assumption proved wrong?

## Framework Application Notes

**For Healthcare IT Context:**

- Remember that "big bang" approaches often aren't viable in healthcare settings
- Each transition state must maintain patient safety and care continuity
- Regulatory compliance (PhilHealth, DOH, Data Privacy) must be maintained throughout all phases
- Clinical workflow disruption must be minimized at each transition point

**Common Focus Drift Patterns to Watch:**

- **Scope Creep:** Adding problems that weren't in the original "must solve" list
- **Criteria Complexity:** Success measures becoming too numerous or complex to track
- **Vision Dilution:** End state becoming unclear due to technical details or stakeholder demands
- **Transition State Perfection:** Spending too much time optimizing intermediate states instead of progressing toward the goal

## Multi-Domain Perspective Check

To ensure comprehensive thinking when answering the three core questions, evaluate each question through these six critical domains:

### Financial Perspective

- From a financial perspective, what problem are we solving?
- From a financial perspective, how will we measure success?
- From a financial perspective, what does success look like?

### Patient Perspective (External Service)

- From a patient perspective, what problem are we solving?
- From a patient perspective, how will we measure success?
- From a patient perspective, what does success look like?

### Staff Perspective (Internal Efficiency)

- From a staff perspective, what problem are we solving?
- From a staff perspective, how will we measure success?
- From a staff perspective, what does success look like?

### Doctor Perspective (Clinical Effectiveness)

- From a doctor perspective, what problem are we solving?
- From a doctor perspective, how will we measure success?
- From a doctor perspective, what does success look like?

### Internal Process Perspective

- From an internal process perspective, what problem are we solving?
- From an internal process perspective, how will we measure success?
- From an internal process perspective, what does success look like?

### Learning & Growth Perspective

- From a learning & growth perspective, what problem are we solving?
- From a learning & growth perspective, how will we measure success?
- From a learning & growth perspective, what does success look like?

## Framework Application & Governance

### Decision Making Hierarchy

**All decisions filter through this priority order:**

1. **Does this serve the core problem?** (Primary filter)
2. **Does this advance our success criteria?** (Measurement filter)
3. **Does this align with our vision of success?** (Alignment filter)
4. **Does this transition state maintain focus while delivering value?** (Transition filter)

### Stakeholder Communication Protocol

**The "Elevator Pitch" Standard:** Every team member should be able to explain the project in 30 seconds using:

- The core problem we're solving
- How we'll know we succeeded
- What success looks like
- Where we are in the journey

**Red Flag Indicators:**

- Team members give different answers to "What problem are we solving?"
- Success criteria have grown beyond 3-5 key measures
- The vision description requires technical jargon to explain
- Transition states are being planned primarily for technical convenience rather than value delivery

### Change Management Integration

**Scope Change Evaluation:** Before approving any scope changes, ask:

1. Does this change serve the original core problem?
2. Does this change improve our ability to meet success criteria?
3. Does this change align with or enhance our vision of success?
4. How does this change affect our transition state planning?

**If the answer to any of these is "no" or "unclear," the change request requires executive-level review and stakeholder realignment.**

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundation Setting

- Establish and document answers to the three core questions
- Gain stakeholder alignment on the elevator pitch
- Map out transition state boundaries and value delivery points

### Phase Planning Process

- For each transition state, revisit the core questions
- Ensure each phase builds toward the ultimate goal
- Validate that the transition serves the problem, not just the technology

### Ongoing Governance

- Weekly focus checks using the litmus tests
- Monthly stakeholder alignment reviews
- Quarterly assessment of transition state effectiveness and scope boundary maintenance

## Implementation Notes & Best Practices

### Common Challenges

**Domain Blind Spots:** Teams often miss domains outside their expertise or areas where stakeholders are silent in engagements. IT teams may miss clinical effectiveness nuances, while clinical teams may overlook financial implications.

**Advisory Guidance:**

- Consider assigning informal "domain champions" during planning sessions to advocate for each perspective
- Actively seek out quieter stakeholders who may represent underweighted domains
- Schedule separate sessions with domain experts if comprehensive perspectives aren't emerging in group settings

### Success Indicators

- All six domain perspectives can articulate the core problem clearly
- Success criteria include meaningful metrics from multiple domains
- The vision of success resonates across different stakeholder groups
- Transition states consider impact and value delivery across all relevant domains
