# Progression of Konsulta

The progression of PhilHealth's primary care benefits, from the initial Konsulta Package (Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama) through various policy revisions and sandbox programs, culminates in the transition to the Yaman ng Kalusugan Program (YAKAP). YAKAP is specifically defined as the **evolution of the PhilHealth Konsulta Program**, building on its foundations and aiming to shift care from reactive treatment toward proactive wellness.

Here is a timeline detailing the key differences and enhancements of the PhilHealth Konsulta Packages until the implementation of YAKAP:
