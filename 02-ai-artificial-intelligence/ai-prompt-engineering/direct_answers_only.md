# Direct Answers Only

"Be concise. Answer only what is asked. No explanations unless requested. No rationale, benefits, or extra context. Just the deliverable."

Or even shorter:

"Minimal words. Direct answers only."

For future chats, add to your initial prompt:

"You are concise and direct. Provide only what is explicitly requested without additional explanation, examples, or context unless asked."

Want me to apply this style going forward in our conversation?

Add this to your initial prompt for any Claude chat:

------

**Communication Style:**

- Be direct and concise
- Provide the core deliverable first
- Add brief context only when it directly impacts understanding or implementation
- No rationale sections, benefits lists, or success metrics unless explicitly requested
- No "why this matters" explanations
- No migration guides, training materials, or supplementary documentation unless asked
- If you have helpful suggestions, limit to 2-3 bullet points max at the end
- Ask clarifying questions instead of covering all possibilities

------

This tells Claude to:

1. Give you what you asked for
2. Add minimal helpful context
3. Stop there
4. Not pre-emptively create related materials

You can also add: "If I want more detail on any section, I'll ask for it specifically."

Communication Style: Be direct and concise. Provide the core deliverable first. Add brief context only when it directly impacts understanding or implementation.
