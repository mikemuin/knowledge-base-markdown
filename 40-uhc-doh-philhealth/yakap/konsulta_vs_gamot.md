# Konsulta vs. GAMOT

The PhilHealth Konsulta benefit package, initially designed for comprehensive outpatient care, has undergone enhancements and a significant shift in its medication coverage with the nationwide implementation of PhilHealth GAMOT (Guaranteed and Accessible Medications for Outpatient Treatment).

Here are the key differences from the original Konsulta, based on the recent enhancements:

- **Medication Coverage and Management:**
  - **Original Konsulta:** Previously covered a list of **21 select drugs and medicines**, including common antimicrobials, anti-asthma drugs, antipyretics, anti-diabetics, anti-dyslipidemia, anti-hypertensives, anti-thrombotics, and anti-histamines.
  - **Enhanced Konsulta with GAMOT:** These **21 medications are now temporarily disabled in the GAMOT App for Calendar Year 2025 or until further notice and are subsumed under PhilHealth GAMOT** for their dispensing and payment. PhilHealth GAMOT itself covers a broader "GAMOT List" of essential medications from the Philippine National Formulary, each with a fixed fee schedule. Beneficiaries under PhilHealth GAMOT have an **Annual Benefit Limit (ABL) of Twenty Thousand Pesos (PHP 20,000.00)** for these outpatient drugs.
- **Capitation Rate (Payment to Providers):**
  - **Enhanced Konsulta:** Beginning January 1, 2024, the maximum per capita amount paid to Konsulta Package Providers (KPPs) increased to **PHP 1,700.00** for both government and private facilities. The KPP receives 40% of this amount based on registered members with a first patient encounter, and the remaining 60% based on performance targets.
- **Co-payment/Balance Billing:**
  - **Enhanced Konsulta:** Private KPPs are now allowed to charge a **co-payment cap of up to PHP 900.00** per annum per beneficiary. Public KPPs, however, are subject to the No Balance Billing (NBB) policy.
- **Diagnostic Services:**
  - **Original Konsulta:** Covered 15 specific laboratory and diagnostic examinations.
  - **Enhanced Konsulta:** Added **mammogram and ultrasound** (specifically for breast, upper abdomen, and pelvic areas) to the list of covered diagnostic services.
- **Authorization Transaction Code (ATC) Requirement:**
  - **Enhanced Konsulta:** The need for an Authorization Transaction Code (ATC) prior to availing Konsulta services has been **removed**.
- **Photo Requirement for Availment:**
  - **Enhanced Konsulta:** A **photograph of the patient** is now required at the KPP for benefit availment. This is for post-audit monitoring purposes.

These changes reflect PhilHealth's efforts to enhance the comprehensiveness of outpatient care and streamline the process of medication access through the dedicated GAMOT package, while adapting payment mechanisms for providers.
