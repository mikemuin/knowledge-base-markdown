## Performance Indicators

### Four Key Performance Areas

| Indicator                        | Target | Weight | Calculation                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Primary Care Consultation** | 100%   | 30%    | Unique patients with consultation ÷ Total patients with FPE  |
| **2. Laboratory Services**       | 50%    | 30%    | Unique patients with lab services ÷ Total patients with FPE  |
| **3. Antibiotic Medicines**      | 15%    | 10%    | Unique patients with antibiotics ÷ Total patients with FPE   |
| **4. Chronic Disease Medicines** | 20%    | 30%    | Unique patients with NCD medicines ÷ Total patients with FPE |

### Sample Performance Calculation

**Scenario**: 14,850 patients with FPE

- Consultations: 8,000 patients
- Laboratory services: 3,000 patients
- Antibiotics: 2,000 patients
- NCD medicines: 1,500 patients

| Indicator              | Actual Performance | Target | Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| **Consultation**       | 54% (8,000/14,850) | 100%   | 0.54  | 30%    | **16%**        |
| **Laboratory**         | 20% (3,000/14,850) | 50%    | 0.40  | 30%    | **12%**        |
| **Antibiotics**        | 13% (2,000/14,850) | 15%    | 0.87  | 10%    | **9%**         |
| **NCD Medicines**      | 10% (1,500/14,850) | 20%    | 0.50  | 30%    | **15%**        |
| **PERFORMANCE FACTOR** |                    |        |       |        | **52%**        |

### Second Tranche Payment Calculation

- **Public Provider**: 14,850 × 0.52 × ₱1,020 = **₱7,876,440**
- **Private Provider**: (14,850 × 0.52 × ₱1,020) - 2% tax = **₱7,718,911**

------

## Age-Specific Considerations

### CRITICAL FINDING: No Age-Specific Performance Factors

**The performance indicators apply universally to ALL ages** - this creates significant problems for providers serving specific age groups.

### Age-Appropriate Preventive Services

While services are age-targeted, **performance metrics are not**:

| Age Group       | Recommended Services           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **0-12 months** | CBC with platelet count        |
| **1-4 years**   | General consultations          |
| **5-9 years**   | General consultations          |
| **10-19 years** | Chest X-ray                    |
| **20-39 years** | PAP Smear/VIA (can be waived)  |
| **40-49 years** | Lipid Profile, FBS, OGTT       |
| **50-59 years** | FOBT (Fecal Occult Blood Test) |
| **60+ years**   | ECG                            |
| **70+ years**   | All previous services          |
| **Risk-based**  | Mammography                    |

## Key Findings and System Issues

### Critical System Design Flaws

1. **Age-Inappropriate Performance Targets**
   - Chronic disease medicine target (30% weight) impossible for healthy children, easily achieved for elderly
   - Laboratory service targets don't align with age-appropriate care for young populations
   - One-size-fits-all approach creates 45% revenue difference between age groups
2. **Financial Disincentives and Advantages**
   - Providers serving children lose 27% of potential revenue (₱459 per patient)
   - Providers serving elderly achieve maximum revenue potential
   - Creates market incentives favoring elderly care over pediatric care
   - May discourage comprehensive family practice
3. **System Bias and Inequity**
   - Performance indicators designed around adult/elderly health patterns
   - Creates inherent advantage for providers with older patient demographics
   - Penalizes appropriate pediatric and young adult care
   - Results in ₱459 per patient revenue disparity based solely on age demographics
4. **Misaligned Clinical Incentives**
   - System could reward inappropriate prescribing (giving diabetes medicines to children)
   - Penalizes appropriate age-specific care patterns
   - Conflicts with evidence-based medicine principles
   - Creates pressure to over-treat young patients or under-serve elderly patients

### Operational Challenges

1. **Data Submission Requirements**
   - Daily/weekly uploads required
   - XML file submissions through HCI Portal
   - Strict deadlines (11:59 PM, 7th day of month)
   - System validation requirements
2. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Photo documentation of patients mandatory
   - Electronic Konsulta Availment Slip (EKAS)
   - Electronic Prescription Slip (EPRESS)
   - Proper encoding in PhilHealth systems
3. **Service Level Agreements**
   - KPPs without mammogram/ultrasound must arrange SLAs within 3 years
   - Additional service notifications required to PhilHealth
   - Telemedicine services must be properly recorded and submitted

### Recommendations for System Improvement

1. **Age-Stratified Performance Indicators**
   - Develop separate targets for pediatric (0-17), adult (18-59), and geriatric (60+) populations
   - Align performance metrics with age-appropriate care standards
   - Weight indicators based on population health needs and clinical evidence
2. **Population-Adjusted Payment Factors**
   - Introduce age-demographic adjustment factors to ensure payment equity
   - Create separate performance benchmarks for different age groups
   - Maintain total capitation amount while adjusting performance calculations
3. **Flexible Service Requirements**
   - Adjust laboratory service targets based on age distribution of patient population
   - Create age-appropriate chronic disease indicators (e.g., asthma for children, diabetes for adults)
   - Allow for population-specific performance calculations
4. **Equity Protection Measures**
   - Ensure equal payment opportunities regardless of patient age demographics
   - Implement minimum performance floors to protect providers serving challenging populations
   - Create incentives for comprehensive, all-age family practice models

### Summary Statistics - Age Impact Comparison

| Patient Population            | Performance Factor | Revenue per Patient | System Advantage        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |

## Conclusion

The PhilHealth Konsulta payment scheme provides a structured approach to primary care funding but contains significant age-related bias that creates unintended consequences for providers. The system **heavily favors providers serving elderly patients** who can achieve 100% performance factors, while **severely penalizing providers serving children** with only 55% achievable performance. This 45% performance gap translates to ₱459 per patient revenue difference, creating market distortions that may undermine comprehensive primary care delivery.

The universal application of adult/elderly-oriented performance indicators highlights the critical need for age-stratified metrics that align financial incentives with appropriate, evidence-based care across all age groups. Healthcare IT professionals implementing Konsulta systems should advocate for demographic-adjusted performance calculations to ensure equitable compensation for quality care regardless of patient population characteristics.
