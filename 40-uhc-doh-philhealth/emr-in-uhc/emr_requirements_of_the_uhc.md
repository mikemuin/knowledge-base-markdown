# EMR Requirements of the UHC

The Universal Health Care (UHC) Act (Republic Act No. 11223) establishes Health Information Systems (HIS), particularly Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), as essential infrastructure for achieving integrated, accessible, and data-driven healthcare.

Here is a detailed overview and presentation on EMRs in UHC, drawing on the provided sources:

------

### 1. What are the EMR Requirements of the UHC?

The UHC Act mandates specific components for health information systems, placing EMRs at the core of integrated service delivery and accountability across the Philippine health sector.

#### A. Mandatory System Components

All health service providers and insurers are legally required to maintain a health information system that includes the following core elements:

1. **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)/EMRs**.
2. **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**.
3. **Human Resource Information System (HRIS)**.
4. **Electronic Prescription Log**.
5. **Electronic Health Commodities Logistics Management Information**.

#### B. Standards and Interoperability

The systems must adhere to strict standards to ensure national data flow:

- **Interoperability:** The EMRs must be electronically uploaded on a regular basis through **interoperable systems** consistent with standards set by the Department of Health (DOH) and PhilHealth. This ensures different information systems can process, share, and exchange data cohesively across boundaries.
- **Validation and Conformance:** Health information systems must undergo and pass **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** to verify adherence to national health data standards for interoperability. Vendors are strongly encouraged to incorporate data visualization dashboards to help Local Government Units (LGUs) and facilities interpret data.

#### C. Data Submission and Repository

- **Mandatory Submission:** All public and private, national and local health-related entities are **required to submit health and health-related data to PhilHealth** (including administrative, public health, medical, pharmaceutical, and health financing data).
- **National Health Data Repository (NHDR):** Data submission must occur through the NHDR, which is established as the **single point of submission and authoritative repository** of the country's health and health-related data. Submission of data to the NHDR is a requirement in the licensing and contracting arrangements for health-related entities.

#### D. Requirements within Health Systems (P/CWHS)

The realization of integrated local health systems mandates specific EMR functionality across networks:

- **Functional EMR Systems:** In **Stage 2** (System Development & Capacity Building), functional EMR systems must be implemented among health facilities within the Province-wide/City-wide Health System (P/CWHS) and must be capable of submitting reports to DOH/PhilHealth.
- **Validated EMR Linkages:** In **Stage 3** (Service Operationalization & Sustained Integration), validated EMR systems must effectively **link Primary Care Provider Networks (PCPNs) to secondary and tertiary care providers** within the P/CWHS.
- **Accessibility:** PCPNs, which form the foundation of Health Care Provider Networks (HCPNs), must ensure patient records are accessible throughout the health system.

### 2. What EMR features are key to make sure UHC is successful?

Successful UHC implementation relies on EMRs transitioning from mere data storage tools to essential, interconnected operational platforms that support care quality and financing.

#### A. Enabling Integration and Continuity of Care

- **Seamless Data Exchange (Interoperability):** The ability to exchange, interpret, and use data seamlessly is crucial for continuity of care, especially since the lack of interoperability often leads to fragmented data systems that disrupt patient care. The Integrated Health Information System (iHIS) aims to ensure data exchange across platforms such as iClinicSys, iHOMIS, and PhilHealth’s eClaims.
- **Referral System Management:** EMRs must be used for **patient navigation and coordination mechanisms** to higher levels of care within the HCPN. The system must be capable of coordinating referrals from PCPNs to referral facilities and back.
- **Core Clinical Modules:** A comprehensive HIS (which includes EMRs) should encompass clinical modules such as laboratory and diagnostics, electronic prescription and dispensing, telemedicine, clinical decision support, and PhilHealth electronic claims processing.

#### B. Supporting Data-Driven Governance and Planning

- **Real-time and Actionable Data:** EMRs must be capable of **real-time information sharing**. A strong and sustainable HIS ensures that health data are **timely, accurate, and actionable**, enabling better decision-making, efficient resource allocation, and improved health outcomes.
- **Evidence-Based Policies:** EMR data supports evidence-informed sectoral policy and planning for UHC. The data generated are intended to guide research and policy-making.

#### C. Enhancing Clinical Efficiency and Quality

- **Minimizing Data Entry Burden:** Effective EMR solutions for front-line workers should maximize care delivery effectiveness and **minimize the data entry burden**.
- **Integrated Care Pathways (ICPs):** The EMR system should be designed to operationalize **Integrated Care Pathways (ICPs)**, which are combinations of clinical practice guidelines and prescriptive referral patterns. Integrating ICPs into the EMR helps ensure seamless health information exchange between care team members.
- **Security and Privacy:** The system must uphold and protect patient privacy and confidentiality in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012.

### 3. What should doctors know about EMR for UHC?

Doctors (Physicians, Nurses, etc.) are critical "Users-Healthcare Workers" in the adoption of EMRs. Their understanding and adherence to the system are essential for UHC success.

#### A. EMRs Define the New Care Delivery Model

- **Primary Care Foundation:** UHC emphasizes shifting the system to prioritize primary care (PHC). EMRs are critical to this shift, enabling the Primary Care Provider (PCP) to serve effectively as the **initial contact and navigator** who guides patients toward cost-efficient and appropriate levels of care.
- **Supporting Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs):** EMRs should incorporate CPGs, which are essential for standardizing clinical care and improving the quality of care, reducing unexplained variation in practice, and managing costs.
- **Patient Safety and Quality:** The core purpose of health information sharing is to provide systemic care quality and safety benefits to individual Filipinos.

#### B. EMRs Impact Financial Accountability and Reimbursement

- **Data is Linked to Financing:** PhilHealth is mandated to move towards performance-driven, prospective payment mechanisms (like capitation and global budgets). EMRs are the platform used to track utilization and performance.
- **Incentives and Compliance:** PhilHealth aims to link provider quality metrics (e.g., adherence to guidelines, patient outcomes) to EMR-based evidence, supporting value-based care.
- **Claims Processing:** EMRs are crucial for PhilHealth electronic claims processing and provider payment. Compliant, EMR-generated submissions recorded at the point of care are necessary to receive PhilHealth payments.

#### C. Data Entry vs. Patient Care

- **Addressing the Data Burden:** Doctors must recognize that current EMR implementations often result in a significant data entry burden that reduces their capacity for care delivery. They should note that the system should eventually be "built into the end-user requirements (health provider, clinicians)" and maximize care delivery effectiveness while minimizing data entry.
- **The Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** Doctors’ data inputs feed the NHDR, which serves as the SSOT for all health data, making their role critical in providing timely and accurate information for policy and planning.

### 4. What is the call to action for doctors about EMR for UHC?

The call to action for doctors involves embracing digital transformation, demanding better system design, and ensuring rigorous data integrity to fulfill the promise of UHC.

1. **Be the Champion for Digital Adoption:** Doctors and clinicians should actively implement and utilize EMR systems that have passed validation (SCIV/NEHEHRSV compliant). They should ensure that the EMR is used **real-time during patient encounters**, not just for batch encoding later, which is currently a common practice hindering efficiency.
2. **Ensure Data Integrity and Point-of-Care Use:** Utilize compliant, EMR-generated submissions recorded at the point of care, and require **exclusive use of interoperable EMRs** (i.e., no parallel non-interoperable systems). Clinicians and doctors should review the data in the EMRs to maintain accuracy.
3. **Drive System Improvement:** Doctors must articulate the functional specifications required for simple census tools and EMR solutions that **minimize data entry burden**. Advocate for systems that incorporate **Integrated Care Pathways (ICPs)** into the workflow.
4. **Support Interoperability:** Work with facility management to ensure their EMR links their PCPN to secondary and tertiary care providers within the HCPN. This involves using the EMR for patient navigation and two-way referrals.
5. **Advocate for Institutional Support:** Push for the creation of **permanent plantilla positions for digital health teams** in hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs) to oversee EMR implementation and provide daily support (configuration, data stewardship, user help, connectivity), as recommended by experts.

### 5. What is the cost of not adopting EMRs among doctors and healthcare organizations?

The costs of non-adoption extend beyond mere technological inconvenience; they undermine the core objectives of UHC, leading to systemic inefficiencies, poor quality of care, and significant financial risk.

#### A. Systemic and Operational Costs

- **Fragmented Data and Disrupted Continuity of Care:** Non-adoption or use of non-interoperable systems perpetuates fragmented data systems that **disrupt the continuity of care**. Non-networked facilities create "blind spots" that impede health system management.
- **Loss of Quality and Safety Benefits:** Lack of interoperability and mandatory data sharing means that health information cannot be seamlessly exchanged, which compromises systemic care quality and safety benefits for individual Filipinos.
- **Increased Workload/Inefficiency:** Healthcare workers routinely face the **burden of using multiple systems**, often requiring double or even triple encoding of the same information when interoperability is lacking. This high data entry burden reduces the capacity of health workers to deliver care.
- **Impaired Decision Making:** Valuable data is unavailable because it is buried in inaccessible silos. This results in **poor quality and untimely generation and reporting of health and health-related data**, which severely impairs data-driven management, policy decision-making, and research.

#### B. Financial and Regulatory Consequences

- **Licensing and Contracting Risk:** The submission of health data via HIS is explicitly a **requirement in the licensing and contracting arrangements** for health facilities. Non-compliance can risk both a provider’s DOH license and PhilHealth accreditation.
- **Loss of Incentives and Delayed Payments:** PhilHealth intends to link provider payment speed or differentials and disincentives to the exclusive use of compliant, EMR-generated submissions recorded at the point of care. Non-compliance risks delays in PhilHealth claims or loss of performance-based incentives.
- **Increased Development Costs (for Vendors/Organizations):** Failure to adopt standardized messaging (like HL7 FHIR) risks creating a proliferation of multiple non-standardized interfaces, forcing EMR providers to build and maintain multiple custom interfaces. This significantly increases development costs and complexity while reducing data consistency.
- **Inability to Track Services:** Non-adoption limits the ability to track the utilization of essential primary care services, hindering monitoring and evaluation efforts essential for UHC success.
