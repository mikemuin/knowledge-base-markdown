# Evolution of HIMSS EMRAM Stages Throughout the Years

## Original EMRAM Model (2005-2011)

The original 8-stage model (Stages 0-7) established the foundation for measuring EMR adoption with basic criteria focused on:

- Implementation of departmental systems
- CPOE adoption
- Nursing documentation
- Clinical decision support functionality
- Medication administration capabilities
- Physician documentation
- Data warehousing

## First Major Revision (2012-2017)

HIMSS made significant adjustments to increase rigor and reflect evolving technology:

### Stage 1 Changes

- Added requirement for three basic ancillary clinical systems (lab, pharmacy, radiology)
- Added criteria for security policies and disaster recovery planning

### Stage 2 Changes

- Strengthened CDR requirements (including documentation of problem lists, medication lists)
- Added health information exchange (HIE) capability
- Required structured templates for CDS foundation

### Stage 3 Changes

- Added nursing/clinical documentation for emergency department
- Required electronic medication administration record (eMAR)
- Introduced nursing care plan requirements
- Added mandated role-based access controls

### Stage 4 Changes

- Expanded CPOE beyond medications to include lab and radiology orders
- Required use of protocols and care pathways across at least one clinical service line
- Added requirement for structured documentation supporting discrete data
- Included drug-drug, drug-allergy interaction checking

### Stage 5 Changes

- Closed-loop medication administration with positive patient ID required
- Added physician documentation templates for progress notes
- Required more sophisticated CDS including variance alerts
- Introduced requirements for physician adoption rates (>50%)

### Stage 6 Changes

- Added requirements for full physician documentation across all clinical areas
- Required advanced CDS capabilities with predictive modeling
- Added drug formulary checking at order entry
- Began requiring structured documentation for discrete data capture across all departments
- Introduced blood administration safety through barcode/RFID verification

### Stage 7 Changes

- Added continuity of care document (CCD) exchange capability
- Required comprehensive data warehousing
- Introduced analytics requirements for population health management
- Required enterprise-wide physician adoption (>90%)
- Added business continuity requirements (99.99% system availability)

## EMRAM 2018 Major Revision

HIMSS significantly restructured EMRAM in 2018 with more stringent requirements and additional focus areas:

### Overall Changes

- Removed Stage 0 (now 7 stages: 1-7)
- Introduced 184 distinct criteria across stages (from approximately 130)
- Added international adaptations to accommodate different countries' healthcare systems
- Incorporated more comprehensive cybersecurity requirements throughout all stages
- Added infrastructure resilience requirements
- Increased focus on clinical outcomes rather than just technology implementation
- Mandated regular revalidation (every 3 years) to maintain certification

### Specific Notable Additions

- **Quality & Safety Focus**: Added clinical quality measures evaluation
- **Patient Engagement**: Incorporated patient portal requirements
- **Analytics Capabilities**: Expanded requirements for using data for improvement
- **Cybersecurity**: Added comprehensive security requirements throughout all stages
- **Interoperability**: Strengthened requirements for health information exchange
- **Mobile Technology**: Added requirements for mobile device integration
- **Closed-Loop Processes**: Expanded beyond medications to other clinical processes

### Stage 7 Major Enhancement

- Required demonstration of improved outcomes through data analytics
- Added requirement for innovation and research using clinical data
- Required disaster recovery capabilities with minimal data loss
- Mandated real-time monitoring and alerting for all critical systems
- Added API/FHIR-based interoperability requirements

## Latest Refinements (2020-Present)

The most recent updates include:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Added criteria for AI implementation in clinical decision support
- **Telehealth Integration**: Requirements for virtual care integration with EMR
- **Patient-Generated Health Data**: Criteria for incorporating data from wearables and home monitoring
- **Social Determinants of Health**: Requirements for capturing and utilizing SDOH data
- **Global Standardization**: Further harmonization of criteria across different countries
- **Digital Maturity**: Focus on measuring digital transformation beyond just EMR adoption
- **Digital Front Door**: Added requirements for comprehensive digital patient experience
- **Precision Medicine**: Requirements for genomic data integration into clinical workflows

## Philippine Context Considerations

In the Philippine healthcare landscape, the EMRAM model application has been adapted to consider:

- Varying resource constraints between private and public hospitals
- PhilHealth electronic claims submission integration requirements
- DOH licensing and accreditation requirements alignment
- Local data privacy regulations (Data Privacy Act compliance)
- Challenges with infrastructure reliability in rural areas
- Focus on essential healthcare information exchange capabilities relevant to local health system fragmentation

These changes reflect HIMSS's response to evolving healthcare technology, increasing focus on meaningful use rather than just implementation, and recognition of the varying global contexts in which healthcare IT operates, including the unique challenges and opportunities within the Philippine healthcare system.
