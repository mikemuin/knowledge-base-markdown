# National Objectives for Health (NOH) - 8-Point Action Agenda

The primary objectives and key strategies for improving health outcomes in the Philippines are outlined in the **National Objectives for Health (NOH) 2023-2028**, developed by the Department of Health (DOH). This document serves as the health sector's medium-term strategy and is articulated through the **8-Point Action Agenda**, aptly titled "Sa Bagong Pilipinas, Bawat Buhay Mahalaga". This agenda aligns with the nation's long-term aspirations expressed in "Ambisyon Natin 2040" and the current administration's "Bagong Pilipinas" vision, which aims for a healthier, more prosperous Philippines.
