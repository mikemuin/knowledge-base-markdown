# 2005 HIMS EMRAM Stage Goals

| **Stage**   | **Components (2005 EMRAM)**                                  | **What This Stage is Gunning For (Technical & Clinical Objectives)** |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stage 7** | Complete EMR; data warehousing; governance; continuity of care; data analytics | **Technical:** Establish enterprise-wide, integrated data infrastructure with analytics and governance for decision support. **Clinical:** Enable longitudinal care, monitor outcomes, and support population health management and predictive care. |
| **Stage 6** | Physician documentation (structured); clinical decision support; full PACS | **Technical:** Standardize and digitize physician notes and diagnostics to enable advanced decision support. **Clinical:** Improve diagnostic efficiency, support clinical decisions at the point of care, and reduce variability in practice. |
| **Stage 5** | Closed-loop medication administration (eMAR, BCMA)           | **Technical:** Achieve full integration of medication orders with administration tools to close the medication loop. **Clinical:** Prevent medication errors, ensure patient safety, and promote accurate medication delivery. |
| **Stage 4** | CPOE; CDS (e.g., drug interactions)                          | **Technical:** Implement electronic provider order entry with real-time guidance. **Clinical:** Reduce errors, ensure compliance with best practices, and improve therapeutic outcomes. |
| **Stage 3** | Nursing/clinical documentation (vitals, flowsheets); CDSS (error checking) | **Technical:** Capture structured clinical data from nursing and allied health providers. **Clinical:** Provide early warnings, standardize care processes, and improve clinical monitoring and documentation fidelity. |
| **Stage 2** | Clinical Data Repository (CDR); internal HIE; basic clinical decision support | **Technical:** Establish a single source of truth across the hospital by aggregating data into a CDR. **Clinical:** Allow clinicians to view results, labs, and documentation in one system to support timely and coordinated care. |
| **Stage 1** | Lab, radiology, pharmacy systems installed                   | **Technical:** Digitize core ancillary services as silos. **Clinical:** Speed up lab/radio/pharmacy turnaround, reduce manual errors, and improve accessibility of diagnostic data. |
| **Stage 0** | All three ancillary systems not installed                    | **Technical:** No foundational digital infrastructure—entirely paper-based. **Clinical:** High clinical risk due to delays, errors, and lack of accessible patient data. Starting point for digital maturity. |
