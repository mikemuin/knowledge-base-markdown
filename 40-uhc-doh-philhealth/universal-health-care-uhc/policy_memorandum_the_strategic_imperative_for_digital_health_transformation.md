## Policy Memorandum: The Strategic Imperative for Digital Health Transformation

**From Software Carpenter to System Architect: A Unified Approach to Achieving Interoperable Universal Health Care**

**Target Audience:** Leaders in the Health Sector, Health IT Industry, Local Government Units (LGUs), and Development Partners.

------

### I. Executive Summary: The Pivot to True Interoperability

The successful realization of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act hinges on developing an Integrated Health Information System (HIS) that functions as the **essential infrastructure of trust**. This system must be capable of providing timely, accurate, and actionable data to support better policy decisions, efficient resource allocation, and continuous quality improvement.

This paper asserts that the national government’s strategy of developing and providing mass EMR software (i.e., iClinicSys and iHOMIS), while rooted in a mandate to ensure access, has become a functional impediment to achieving UHC integration. This approach:

1. **Imposes operational burdens** on frontline workers, reducing capacity for direct patient care.
2. **Stifles the specialized Health IT market**, preventing LGUs from procuring quality, fit-for-purpose operational systems.
3. **Diverts DOH resources** away from its critical, non-negotiable stewardship role: acting as the system architect and standards enforcer.

**The government must urgently pivot its role from application developer to system architect of national digital standards and core infrastructure.** This shift unlocks the required local financing and industry innovation necessary to fully digitize the public health system.

### II. The UHC Mandate: Defining Roles and Addressing Gaps

#### A. The Financial Framework Supports Local Investment

The argument that Local Government Units (LGUs) require free government software because they lack funds for Health IT investments is now outdated due to the UHC financing architecture:

- **Explicit Health IT Funding:** The UHC Act mandates the creation of the **Special Health Fund (SHF)** for all Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS). This fund, which pools DOH grants and PhilHealth income, is explicitly designated to cover **"Capital investment such as, but not limited to, infrastructure, equipment, and information technology"**.
- **Strategic Local Planning:** LGUs are required to integrate their health ICT investment needs, cost requirements, and proposed fund sources (including the SHF) into their medium-term **Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH)**. This planning mechanism is designed to empower LGUs to finance standards-compliant, market-driven EMR systems.
- **Conclusion:** The financial solution is already established in law. The challenge is ensuring LGUs exercise their financial autonomy and strategically utilize the SHF for modern, operational EMRs, rather than relying on fragmented, functionally constrained free systems.

#### B. The Operational Failure of Centralized Systems

For UHC to succeed, systems must deliver integrated, people-centered care. Current centralized software is failing to meet this standard, as evidenced by system assessments:

- **Focus on Reporting:** DOH EMRs are often perceived as being designed for the **"statistician's requirement at the national level"** rather than prioritizing clinical workflow, creating an **"added burden"** for end-users.
- **Fragmentation:** This operational gap forces health workers into the redundant task of **double or triple encoding** data across non-interoperable platforms (such as local EMRs, PhilHealth claims systems, and DOH applications). This inefficiency undermines the goal of seamless data flow.
- **HRH Capacity Gap:** Even when DOH software is provided, facilities struggle to utilize it due to the chronic shortage of dedicated IT personnel. The inability to overcome the **Personal Services (PS) limitation** on local government budgets prevents the creation of permanent digital health teams.

#### C. The DOH's Paramount Role: Architecture and Standards

The DOH, as the **overall leader of the health sector**, must dedicate its limited resources to non-delegable stewardship functions:

- **Setting Mandatory Standards:** The DOH is tasked with defining and enforcing **National Health Data Standards for Interoperability** and ensuring compliance through the **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)** framework. This process is crucial because it ensures that all systems—public and private—can seamlessly exchange data.
- **Foundational Architecture:** The strategic direction requires deploying a **national interoperable digital health ecosystem** anchored by the **National Health Data Repository (NHDR)**. This necessitates DOH leadership in defining the architectural components, including foundational elements like **Terminology Services, Client Registry, and Health Facility Registry**.

### III. Priority Recommendations: A Shared Roadmap for Transformation

To realize the vision of UHC—a health system that achieves **better health outcomes, is responsive to the needs of the people, and provides financial risk protection**—we call upon all key stakeholders to commit to the following strategic actions:

#### 1. Strategic Leadership and Governance (DOH, PhilHealth, DILG)

The highest levels of government must enforce a clear, unified direction for digital health:

- **Cabinet-Level Enforcement:** Immediately strengthen the digital health governance committee to **secure cabinet-level participation** or designate alternates with binding decision-making authority. This is necessary to mandate compliance and ensure long-term stability across agencies.
- **Finalize and Implement the National Digital Health Strategy (NDHS):** The NDHS must be finalized and launched to provide clear, actionable direction, standards, and milestones for HIS development nationwide.
- **Focus on Foundational Registries:** DOH must prioritize investment and deployment of **foundational registries** and mandate adoption of **HL7 FHIR messaging standards**. These tools are the technical prerequisite for enabling secure, person-centric data sharing (PHIE) across all providers.

#### 2. Local Investment and Accountability (LGUs, DILG)

LGUs must leverage their financing capacity to drive market adoption of quality EMRs:

- **Mandate EMR Roadmaps in LIPH:** DOH and DILG must revise the **LIPH template** to **mandate the inclusion of EMR implementation roadmaps, staff training plans, and interoperability compliance** as core investment requirements. This ensures the strategic use of the SHF for quality IT investments.
- **Address the HRH Gap:** DOH, DILG, and DBM must collaboratively review policies to strategically utilize the **National Health Workforce Support System (NHWSS)** and leverage the LIPH to fund and deploy dedicated IT personnel, circumventing the existing **Personal Services (PS) cap** barrier.
- **Institutionalize CIO Roles:** Jointly institutionalize the designation of **Chief Information Officer (CIO) positions** at the LGU level to ensure accountability and alignment of health sector ICT needs with the LGU’s Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP).

#### 3. Market Development and Compliance (Health IT Industry, PhilHealth)

The private health IT market must be enabled and incentivized to serve the public sector:

- **Tie Reimbursements to Digital Readiness:** PhilHealth must use its contracts to **incentivize the incorporation of health information systems** and link reimbursements to **HIS adoption rates** and **standards compliance**. Providers must be rewarded for submitting EMR-generated, standards-compliant data in real-time.
- **Enforce SCIV and Sunset Interim Systems:** The DOH must rigorously enforce the **SCIV framework** to ensure that any third-party EMR used in public facilities achieves **true interoperability**. PhilHealth must establish a **firm timeline to discontinue the interim eKonsulta solution** to eliminate redundant data entry and accelerate the alignment of EMR providers.
- **Market Opportunity:** The Health IT industry must respond by investing in solutions that pass the SCIV process, integrating capabilities that prioritize clinical efficiency, and are designed to function seamlessly within the government’s new architectural framework (NHDR, FHIR).

### IV. Conclusion: Securing the Data-Driven Foundation

The transition to a **fully integrated, people-centered, and interoperable health system** is the definitive path to UHC realization, targeted for 2027. This transformation requires the DOH to embrace its full authority as the digital architect, regulating the data flow and the market rather than competing within it.

By adopting these strategic recommendations, we ensure that:

- **Data becomes a universal public good**.
- **LGUs utilize their mandated funds** (SHF) to procure high-quality operational tools.
- **The Health IT industry scales up** to deliver the innovations necessary for modern clinical care.

This is a commitment to a **whole-of-system and whole-of-society approach** that transforms fragmented records into a unified story, securing the data-driven foundations of Universal Health Care for every Filipino.
