## Define the Data Before the System: Why NHDR Needs a Canonical Model First

The biggest mistake in the Philippines’ digital health reform isn’t lack of funding, or even political will. It’s the assumption that building systems will automatically create interoperability.

The National Health Data Repository (NHDR) is a perfect case in point. For two years, multiple agencies have debated what platform to use, what standards to adopt, and who will manage it — yet no one has formally defined **what data the NHDR will actually contain**.

Before any system can exchange or analyze information, there must be agreement on meaning — *the shape, structure, and semantics of health data*. That’s what a **canonical data model** does. It is the shared language that binds diverse systems together.

Without it, every EMR, HIS, and claims system will continue speaking its own dialect, and NHDR will remain another silo wearing a national label.

------

### The Missing Foundation: What a Canonical Model Is

A **canonical data model** is the master template for how information is structured across all systems.
It defines, for each domain — patient, encounter, diagnosis, procedure, provider, facility, claim, laboratory result — the fields, formats, and relationships that must exist for interoperability.

For example:

- “Patient birthdate” must follow ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
- “Diagnosis” must reference ICD-10 codes.
- “Facility ID” must come from the official National Health Facility Registry (NHFR).
- “Provider ID” must come from the Provider Registry (PRC or DOH).

Once these definitions exist, every system can map its internal data to this shared model, regardless of what protocol (FHIR, HL7 v2, CSV, JSON) it uses.

The canonical model is **the data Rosetta Stone**. It’s how the NHDR can receive data from anywhere and make sense of it.

------

### Why the NHDR Stalled Without It

The NHDR’s delay isn’t just bureaucratic — it’s architectural. Agencies jumped straight to technology decisions before agreeing on semantics.
As a result:

- EMR vendors built different schemas for the same data.
- PhilHealth and DOH defined their own formats for claims and service data.
- LGUs invented local Excel templates for reporting.
- Every integration project ended up writing one-off transformations that can’t scale.

This is why the Philippines has dozens of “health information systems” but no “health information system.” Everyone’s collecting data — but no one’s speaking the same language.

The situation is a bit like trying to build a national railway before deciding track gauge. Every train works — just not together.

------

### What the Canonical Model Enables

1. **Interoperability by design.**
When everyone maps to a single canonical structure, data becomes exchangeable even if protocols differ. One system can send HL7 v2, another JSON, and NHDR can still understand both.
2. **Cleaner data aggregation.**
Because the model enforces consistent identifiers and formats, the same patient or facility can be accurately linked across sources. Analytics become meaningful instead of approximate.
3. **Reduced vendor lock-in.**
Vendors can build to a published standard, ensuring future compatibility. Replacing systems becomes easier because the data contract remains constant.
4. **Policy agility.**
Once the data structure is stable, policies and analytics can evolve without changing every system underneath.
5. **Future readiness.**
The canonical model provides the bridge to FHIR and other standards. You can evolve technology incrementally without redesigning data semantics.

------

### How to Define It

Creating a canonical model doesn’t require years of committees. It requires a small, technically competent team that understands health data, local workflows, and global standards.

Here’s how it can be done:

1. **Start from existing sources.**
Gather data dictionaries from PhilHealth claims, DOH hospital information systems, Konsulta EMRs, FHSIS, and laboratory systems. Identify common fields and overlaps.
2. **Adopt global conventions.**
Use HL7 FHIR R4 resource definitions as a reference, but simplify them for local context. Not every field is needed. The goal is alignment, not replication.
3. **Define each domain clearly.**
   - **Patient:** identifiers, demographics, contact, and household linkages.
   - **Encounter:** visit type, service location, attending provider, disposition.
   - **Diagnosis:** ICD-10 codes, date, source system.
   - **Procedures and Labs:** procedure code, test code (LOINC or local), result, units.
   - **Claims:** case type, amount, adjudication status.
   - **Facility and Provider:** reference to registry IDs.
4. **Publish it openly.**
Release the NHDR Canonical Dataset v1.0 as a public document and API schema. Transparency will attract collaboration from vendors and developers.
5. **Version it.**
Health data evolves. Every update should have a clear version number and changelog so systems can align gradually.
6. **Govern it.**
Create a small “NHDR Data Standards Council” co-chaired by DOH and PhilHealth, with participation from DICT, NPC, and LGU representatives. Their job: maintain, update, and approve changes.

### What It Should Look Like

The canonical model doesn’t need to be complex. A functional version might consist of around 200–250 data elements covering these domains:

| Domain              | Key Fields                                          | Source               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Patient             | ID, Name, DOB, Sex, Address, Contact                | PhilHealth / PhilSys |
| Encounter           | Date, Facility ID, Provider ID, Visit Type, Outcome | EMR/HIS              |
| Diagnosis           | ICD-10, Diagnosis Type, Onset, Resolution           | EMR                  |
| Procedure           | Procedure Code, Date, Provider                      | EMR/LIS              |
| Laboratory          | LOINC, Result, Unit, Reference Range                | LIS                  |
| Claim               | Claim ID, Case Type, Service Dates, Amount          | PhilHealth           |
| Facility            | NHFR Code, Name, Type, PSGC                         | DOH                  |
| Provider            | PRC ID, Name, Role, Facility Affiliation            | PRC/DOH              |
| Product             | Drug/Device Code, Name, Category                    | FDA                  |
| Public Health Event | Program ID, Disease, Case Classification            | DOH                  |

This becomes the **contract** between systems and the NHDR. It’s not glamorous, but it’s the single most important deliverable for any data reform.

### The Misconception About Standards

Many policymakers think adopting a standard like HL7 or FHIR automatically solves interoperability. It doesn’t.

Standards describe *how* data moves; a canonical model defines *what* moves and *what it means*.
FHIR, HL7, or CSV are transport formats. The canonical model is the content.

In other words:
You can’t standardize transport before you standardize meaning. That’s why pushing for a “FHIR-first” approach, when no canonical dataset exists, is like arguing over what kind of envelope to use before writing the letter.

------

### How It Fixes Governance

Once a canonical model exists, governance finally becomes concrete.

- **Policy becomes technical.** DOH can define exactly which data fields facilities must report and how they’ll be validated.
- **Privacy becomes manageable.** NPC can review data definitions for compliance and sensitivity.
- **Accountability becomes measurable.** Facilities can be audited based on defined data quality metrics — completeness, timeliness, and validity.

Governance stops being theoretical and starts being enforceable.

------

### The Role of Local Systems

A common fear is that defining a national data model will “force” local systems to change. It shouldn’t.
The canonical model doesn’t dictate internal databases; it defines the exchange contract.

Local EMRs can keep their own schemas. They just need to map or export data that aligns with the canonical model.
That’s how interoperability works — through translation, not replacement.

------

### A Call for NHDR Canonical Dataset v1.0

Before the Philippines spends another peso on integration platforms or health data warehouses, it should produce one thing:
**NHDR Canonical Dataset v1.0** — a living document that defines every data element, code set, and validation rule for national health data exchange.

This single artifact would unlock everything else:

- Vendors can align their EMRs and APIs.
- Facilities know what to capture.
- DOH and PhilHealth can harmonize requirements.
- Data governance can finally be enforced.

Without it, all system development is guesswork.

------

### The Bottom Line

Interoperability isn’t a technical problem — it’s a semantic one.
Systems don’t fail because they lack servers or code; they fail because they can’t agree on what “patient,” “diagnosis,” or “encounter” actually mean.

The Philippines doesn’t need another system yet. It needs **agreement** — a shared model of meaning, structure, and accountability.

Define the data first. The system will follow.
