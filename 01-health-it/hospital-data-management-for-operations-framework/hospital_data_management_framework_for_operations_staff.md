## Key Questions for Each Step

When evaluating your hospital's data management, ask these questions for each step:

1. **Who** is responsible for this step?
2. **How quickly** does this need to happen?
3. **What format** is needed?
4. **What happens** if this step fails?
5. **How do we ensure** data quality and accuracy?

------

## Philippine Healthcare Context

This framework is particularly important in Philippine hospitals because:

- **PhilHealth requirements** depend on accurate data capture and sharing
- **DOH reporting** requires reliable data compilation and analysis
- **Data Privacy Act** compliance requires proper security measures
- **Accreditation standards** require systematic data management
- **Patient safety** depends on accurate, accessible information

------

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start simple:** Focus on one step at a time
2. **Train staff:** Ensure everyone understands their role in each step
3. **Monitor regularly:** Check if each step is working effectively
4. **Improve continuously:** Look for ways to make each step better
5. **Document processes:** Write down how each step should be done

Remember: Good data management isn't about technology—it's about ensuring the right information gets to the right people at the right time to provide excellent patient care.
