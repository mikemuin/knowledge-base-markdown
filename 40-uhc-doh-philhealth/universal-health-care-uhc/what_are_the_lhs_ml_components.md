# What are the LHS ML Components?

The **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** is a multi-tiered monitoring framework used to track the progressive realization and integration of local health systems into Province-wide and City-wide Health Systems (P/CWHS).

The framework is composed of **three primary levels of progression**, each covering specific Key Result Areas (KRAs).

Here are the three defined levels of the LHS ML:

### 1. Level I: Preparatory Level

The Preparatory Level covers **Key Result Areas (KRAs) relating to preparatory works and other supporting mechanisms** that are necessary to facilitate the integration of local health systems.

**Characteristics:**

- A P/CWHS site that achieves this level has completed all preparatory level KRAs.
- It signifies that the P/CWHS, including its component Local Government Units (LGUs), has been **assessed on its readiness to managerially and financially integrate** their local health systems.
- Examples of preparatory work include conducting **baseline assessments** of the LGU's health capacity and corresponding investment needs for integration.

### 2. Level II: Organizational Level

The Organizational Level covers **KRAs that are important for the organization and management of integrated local health systems**. This level also reflects other KRAs pertaining to reforms provided under the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act that affect the success of integration.

**Characteristics:**

- A P/CWHS that achieves this level has reached Level 2 if it achieves all Preparatory (Level 1) and Organizational (Level 2) KRAs.
- This site is categorized as an **Organized P/CWHS**.
- An Organized P/CWHS has **available network-wide guidelines, resources, and management structures** needed to facilitate and sustain the integration.
- Examples of requirements include the creation and formalization of the **Special Health Fund (SHF) depository bank account**, the availability of an **HRH plan** integrated into the Local Investment Plan for Health (LIPH), and having the LIPH/Annual Operational Plan (AOP) concurred by the concerned Center for Health Development (CHD).

### 3. Level III: Functional Level

The Functional Level covers **KRAs on the monitoring of functionality of the integrated management support systems**.

**Characteristics:**

- This stage is characterized by the **operationalization and consistent delivery** of integrated health services and functional management support systems, with an emphasis on **monitoring for functionality and impact**.
- A P/CWHS that achieves all KRAs of the LHS ML is categorized as a **Functional P/CWHS**.
- A Functional P/CWHS has already **operationalized and institutionalized network-wide management support systems**.
- This level typically includes the **measurement of quantitative performance indicators** and the submission of various reports.
- Examples include monitoring the **functionality of the integrated local health system**, achieving the **exclusive use of the SHF Budget for health programs**, and demonstrating a **validated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system that effectively links Primary Care Provider Network (PCPN) members to secondary and tertiary care providers** within the P/CWHS.

### Context and Usage of LHS ML

The LHS ML is a critical tool for local health system management.

- The implementation of the LHS ML is guided by **Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0037**.
- The overall framework adopts the **World Health Organization's six building blocks** of a functional health system: Leadership and Governance, Financing, Health Workforce, Information, Medical Products/Vaccines/Technologies, and Service Delivery.
- The LHS ML serves as the **main reference** for the Department of Health (DOH) and external stakeholders when providing technical assistance and determining the kind and level of **assistance, incentives, and/or awards** to LGUs supporting integration efforts.
- It is used in **complementation with the Local Government Unit Health Scorecard (LGU HSC)** to monitor and evaluate the performance and progress of LGUs.
- The tool is used by LGUs to **assess their current level of maturity** concerning P/CWHS integration, identify strengths and weaknesses, and inform the development of their **LIPH** (Local Investment Plan for Health).
- To facilitate data collection and analysis, there is a **Local Health Systems Maturity Level Information System (LHSML IS)**, which is monitored by the Bureau of Local Health Systems Development (BLHSD).
- As of 2023, **63 out of 73 UHC Integration Sites** achieved at least **70% of the Level 2 KRAs**.
