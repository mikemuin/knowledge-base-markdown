The entries in your notes refer to the **Foundational Stages for Universal Health Care (UHC) Realization** and specifically detail the progression of the **Information Track** within the UHC implementation roadmap. These stages represent a phased approach to achieving UHC, outlining specific, practical achievements.

This staged model aligns conceptually with the three levels of progression defined in the **Local Health Systems Maturity Levels (LHS ML)** monitoring framework (Preparatory, Organizational, and Functional Levels).

Here is a detailed breakdown of these stages, including the missing definition for Stage 1:

------

### The Foundational Stages for UHC Realization

The overall progression model moves through three stages: Foundational Readiness (Stage 1), System Development & Capacity Building (Stage 2), and Service Operationalization & Sustained Integration (Stage 3).

The specific points you noted concern the requirements under the **Information Track** (or Information Management Building Block) of these stages.

#### What is Stage 1? (Foundational Readiness)

**Stage 1: Foundational Readiness** is the initial stage, focusing on **readiness, formal commitments, and baseline assessments** necessary to initiate health system reforms and integration.

Under the **Information Track** (Health Information Management System), the requirement for Stage 1 is centered on assessment and planning:

- **Baseline assessment, gaps analysis, and identification of investment needs for health information management/ICT systems** are conducted.
- This assessment specifically includes evaluating the **state of ICT governance** in the Province-wide and City-wide Health System (P/CWHS), covering strategic and investment planning for health information management/ICT.

#### What is Stage 2? (System Development & Capacity Building)

This stage focuses on **establishing network-wide guidelines, resources, and management structures** needed to facilitate and sustain the integration of local health systems.

The requirements you noted, which correspond to the **Organizational Level (Level II)** of the LHS ML for the Information Management System characteristic, are:

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Stage 2: System Development and Capacity Building**       | This stage is about building the components necessary for UHC. |          |
| **Functional EMR systems in P/CWHS facilities**             | **Functional Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems are implemented** among health facilities within the P/CWHS. |          |
| **Must be capable of submitting reports to DOH/PhilHealth** | The EMR systems must be capable of **submitting reports to DOH/PhilHealth**. |          |
| **Related requirement:**                                    | A **health information management/ICT development plan for the entire P/CWHS is established**. |          |

#### What is Stage 3? (Service Operationalization and Sustained Integration)

This stage is characterized by the **operationalization and consistent delivery** of integrated health services and functional management support systems, with an emphasis on **monitoring for functionality and impact**.

The requirements you noted, which correspond to the **Functional Level (Level III)** of the LHS ML for the Information Management System characteristic, are:

| Element                                                      | Description according to Sources                             | Citation |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Stage 3: Service Operationalization and Sustained Integration** | This stage demonstrates that the health system is actively working and achieving results. |          |
| **Validated EMR systems required**                           | The EMR system must be **validated**.                        |          |
| **Must link Primary Care Provider Networks to secondary and tertiary care** | **Validated electronic medical record (EMR) systems effectively link PCPNs to secondary and tertiary care providers** within the P/CWHS. |          |
| **Patient records must be accessible throughout health system** | The required functionalities of an integrated Health Information System (HIS) include the capacity to coordinate referrals from **PCPN to referral facilities (secondary/tertiary)**, from **referral facilities to apex hospital/s**, and back from **referral facilities or apex hospital/s to PCPN**. The broader Integrated HIS must ensure a patient records management system (including electronic health records) that ensures **records are accessible by all facilities or providers within the health care provider networks** or among other facilities as necessary. |          |

### Context of "Validated" EMR Systems

The requirement for a **"Validated EMR system"** in Stage 3 is crucial and relates directly to the mandatory compliance process known as **Standards Conformance and Interoperability Validation (SCIV)**.

- All health care providers and insurers must subject their Health Information Systems (HIS) to **SCIV**, or its equivalent, regardless of the system's development or implementation stage.
- A **validated module** refers to an Integrated Health Information System (iHIS) module that has **passed the software standards conformance and interoperability validation** of the Department of Health (DOH), PhilHealth, and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) regarding minimum scope, standards, and level of functionality.
- To achieve Stage 3 functionality, the integrated HIS must ultimately **integrate with the Philippine Health Information Exchange (PHIE)**. This integration represents the final step (Stage 3) of the **iHIS Implementation Model (iHISIM)**, deployable within **34–36 months**.
